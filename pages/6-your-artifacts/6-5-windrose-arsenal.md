# Windrose Arsenal

## Blue Jade Flying Fang Daggers, Artifact 4

Tepet Karst was an adopted daughter of Tepet himself, one of his beloved scouts.
A master of the Eastern Rose _yamabushi_ school, she was a scout and
spirit-talker of great renown. After Tepet's elevation to matriarch, Karst was
charged to chart the Blessed Isle.

In preparation for her voyage, Karst's husband forged her the Windrose Arsenal.
He cast blue jade from the stone of their home in Lord's Crossing, that no
matter where she went she would find her way home. He harvested meteor iron from
the soaring gorges of the Imperial Mountain, that no matter where she went she
would never be lost and spirits would bow to her.

After several voyages and expeditionary missions on the Isle and abroad, Tepet
Karst had produced some of the most lovely maps; even today, her work is
displayed in the _yamabushi_ halls of Lord's Crossing.

Tepet surrendered the Windrose Arsenal to Cynis Fa-Len as part of the
husband-price for three Tepet husbands to marry three Cynis daughters--among
them Cynis Jaylah. Fa-Len gave Jaylah the Arsenal as her graduation gift; no
matter where Jaylah wanders, she must now constantly be reminded of her marriage
burden, and of her mother's _sincere_ and _boundless_ generosity.

## Aesthetics

The Windrose Arsenal is a beautiful necklace made from meteor iron and blue
jade. It has a large socket for a hearthstone; when there is no hearthstone, it
is an attractive asymmetric absence.

The Arsenal can summon an array of eight phantom kunai. Each knife corresponds
to one of the Eight Directions. They look as if they are made of crystal or
glass, and each one trails a unique color of light. When they strike a target,
they shatter in a cascade of ice and lightning, a flash of a trigram, and then
reappear in orbit around you a moment later.

## Evocations of the Windrose Arsenal

All Artifact Thrown weapons gain the following effect:

  This weapon automatically returns to you after use.

While you are attuned to the Windrose Arsenal, you may summon or banish it as
part of your _draw/ready weapon_ action. You may switch between using the knives
as a Thrown weapon and a melee weapon on your turn without using the
_draw/ready weapon_ action.

You can snap the knives to face in their proper directions with just a thought.
As long as you are attuned, you get the benefits of the _Direction Sense_ Merit.

You awaken [Stability of the Omphalos](/#stability-of-the-omphalos) at no cost
when you attune to the Windrose Arsenal.

### Stability of the Omphalos

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One turn
>
> **Keywords**: Perilous
>
> **Prerequisites**: None

_The Center direction is associated with the house of Battles. It is the_
_foundation of all other directions and represents stability amidst chaos. The_
_center protects from harm and prevents rapid degradation. The center is the_
_domain of Pasiap, the Earth Dragon, protector and defender._

The Windrose Arsenal rises up to defend you, a flying barrier of knives that
turns away any incoming danger. You get light cover until your next turn. The
cover moves with you as you move.

    Light Cover: +1 Defense from all incoming attacks.

As a result of the stabilizing power of the center, you get heavy cover against

### Levante of a Thousand Blossoms

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Attack Roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Dual
>
> **Prerequisites**: None

_The house of Endings controls the cycle of starting and ceasing. From the_
_East, we learn the lesson that all things have a beginning and an end--all_
_things come in cycles. The eastern dagger is named_ ☲ Lí, _trails purple_
_light, and is associated with the peacock. In the elemental cycle, Lí commands_
_the element of wood and the domain of Sextes Jylis, the spreader of grass and_
_lord of healing._

#### Withering

Your next **decisive** attack made with the Arsenal against the same target
gains "**AIM** -- Also add your Aim bonus dice to your raw damage."

#### Decisive

Gain a reflexive Aim on the next **withering** attack you make against this same
target with the Windrose Arsenal.

### Saffron-Painted Ostro

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Escape); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisites**: None

_The south is the seat of the house of Journeys, which governs travel and the_
_freedom that movement provides. Freedom of movement and joyful motion are the_
_domain of the house of Journeys. The southern dagger is named_ ☰ Qián, _trails_
_orange light, and is associated with the mighty three-horned ox-dragon. In the_
_elemental cycle, Qián is the domain of Hesiesh, the Fire Dragon, the lord of_
_fiery devotion and self-control._

Whenever you roll against a difficulty to overcome anything that would deny you
freedom of movement, check if your (Essence) exceeds the difficulty. If so, or
if the obstacle is completely mundane (plain rope, silk sheets, etc.), you
escape automatically. Otherwise, you get (Essence) automatic successes on the
action.

If you are opposing another character who restricts your freedom of movement--
for example, a disengage action or breaking a grapple-- double 9s.
