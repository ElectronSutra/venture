# Essence

This section is going to get metaphysically wanky, I apologize.

This covers some basics of your nature that you learned in school after you
Exalted.

## Essence Is the Force

_Essence_ is the metaphysical energy that permeates all things living and
non-living. Some scholars call it _qi_, _mana_, or _prana_. The qi of the world
is ever-present and ineffable.

Princes of the Earth are able to channel Essence from both their soul and from
the soul of the world.

## Anima

All living things have an _anima_, an invisible field of energy that surrounds
them. When the Chosen pull Essence from the soul of the world, the remnant
energy cascades across their anima and makes it light up.

Your anima is also called your _subtle body_ or _vital field_.

## Iconic Displays

Your anima is an expression of your soul into the world around you. When it
becomes sufficiently permeated with Essence, it sparks to life in a huge,
beautiful display of your soul to all who can see. This is called your _iconic_
_display_, and it features imagery, sounds, and smells that reflect your inner
self.

You have full control over your iconic display. It is fixed in one configuration
unless something really radical happens that changes you fundamentally as a
person.

## Anima Flux

The power of the Dragon-Blooded is _so_ mighty and _so_ magnificent that it can
cause major issues for those caught in its display. All Dragon-Blooded manifest
"anima flux" when they are iconic.

## Essence Fever

The same raw energy that expresses itself in flux is always somewhere inside
you. While it is bottled up, this energy is often called your "Essence fever."

Your Essence fever burns inside your soul. It pushes you to do legendary things.
It means that you will never be idle; if you are idle, your soul will start to
crisp in the heat of your glory and you will be stirred to action.
