# The Immaculate Dragons

The Immaculate Dragons are the five warrior-saints that founded Immaculatism and
wrote the first of the Immaculate Texts. The Immaculate Dragons fulfill a
messianic role, having brought the wisdom of the Immaculate Order to the masses
after their conquest of the Anathema. They also fulfill an aspirational role, as
all Immaculates are encouraged to emulate them and their virtues.

## Daana'd

Danaa'd, the Arbiter of the Immaculate Complaint, is the Immaculate Dragon of
water. She is frequently depicted as a dark-haired woman in a breasplate,
carrying either a sword or a spear. In her warrior aspect, she is sometimes
presented with a long, curling tongue, claws, and black skin; this figure is
often called _Vengeant Daana'd_. In her aspect as an arbiter and judge, she is
often depicted blindfolded and strangling a serpent, which is said to represent
ignorance and prejudice. This _Blind Danaa'd_ aspect is often seen at seats of
government or at the domiciles of judges.

### Early Life of Daana'd

Daana'd is known to hail from a mystical kingdom called Sua, described in the
Texts as a temperate land of pearl. The physical location of Sua is disputed by
scholars. A majority believe it to be near the island of Soham in the Pendant
Isles, at the far western reaches of the Blessed Isle. Others claim it to be
even further, in the islands of the Southwest near the Caul, citing that Daana'd
is said to have "sailed across the waters" to find the Isle.

Three parallel narratives of Daana'd's birth exist in various texts. In the
first, Daana'd is said to have risen from the sea fully-formed as a baby, and
was carried to shore on the tides by a huge purple lotus flower. In the second,
Daana'd is said to have been born from a mighty pearl, coveted by the king of
Sua, which hatched like an egg when she was ready to be made. Lastly, Daana'd is
sometimes said to have been born to a sworn virgin sailor woman, who conceived
the child after receiving a vision of the Water Dragon beneath the sea.

Despite the fuzzy circumstances surrounding Daana'd's origin, the Texts are
largely in agreement about her childhood. It is said that by the time she was
five years old, Daana'd could speak as eruditely as a grown woman, and did not
need to drink, drawing instead on her own glory. Fish and crustaceans would
offer themselves to her so that she would not grow hungry. She was famed among
her people for her intelligence, martial skill, and judgement.

### The Trials of Daana'd

Upon coming of age, Daana'd rejected her childhood name, shaved her beard, and
set out into the world as a wandering magistrate seeking justice and
righteousness. The many adventures she got up to are compiled in part in the
_Younger Epic of Daana'd_. These tales emphasize Daana'd's skill at arms, but
more importantly, her wits and cleverness. In the _Younger Epic_, Daana'd wins
through ingenuity and deception as often as through martial conquest.

Eventually, Daana'd became so famed that the devil-kings of the Realm Before
came to test her virtue. The Texts recount that she endured five tests, one
each for the Forsaken, the Blasphemous, the Unclean, the Wretched, and the
Deceivers. However, only two stories are recognized as canonical by the
Immaculate Order, with the other three considered apocryphal.

The Test of the Crowning Sun was the test of the Blasphemous, which Daana'd
overcame with ease. The second test, the test of the Wretched, involved Daana'd
battling with the cruel Anathema warlord Moon-Cursed Gushan. This story
remains an extremely popular folktale. Formal Immaculate recitations emphasize
Daana'd's moral superiority -- Daana'd is self-sufficient and uses secrets to
protect the innocent from harm, where Gushan is cruel and unable to speak the
truth to his allies in his time of need. The popular retelling involves a lot
more duels.

### The Schooling of Samwat

Daana'd's antithesis is the Unmanly Babbler, a fool who relies on others to fix
their problems when the real solution lies within. In many of the Daana'd
stories, the boy Samwat is understood to represent this antithesis. A coward, a
fool, and a devoted follower of Daana'd, the character of Samwat seems to exist
in the Daana'd stories largely to ruin things, make poor decisions, and be
educated by Daana'd on his failings.

Dozens of parables, collectively the "Schooling of Samwat", detail his failings
and how Daana'd corrected them, often with clear morals for the reader. Many of
these fables are apocryphal, but a handful are canonical within the Order.
Scholars believe that if Daana'd's homeland of Sua were ever to be found, the
true canon of the Schooling of Samwat could be uncovered.

### The Epic of Daana'd Descendant

More famous than any other Daana'd story, the _Epic of Daana'd Descendant_ is
the defining epic of Daana'd and the one which most shapes her legacy and
image. Beginning shortly after the Five Days of Mela and the Immolation of
Hesiesh, the twelve parts of the _Descendant_ tell the story of Daana'd's
quest to imprison the souls of the Anathema deep beneath the sea.

Throughout the epic, Daana'd reflects on her duty and her struggle coming to
accept that she, like Hesiesh, must sacrifice herself for the good of humanity.
Other chapters chronicle her _Journey to the West_-like travels in the mythical
kingdoms beneath the sea, before finally assembling the required pieces of the
Jade Prison and making the ultimate sacrifice to seal the souls of the
devil-kings that they will never rise again.

The _Descendant_ is a transcription of the oral tradition of the epic on the
Silk-and-Pearl Peninsula, and thus exists in many forms, each reflecting a
different oral history. In some renditions, Daana'd remains beneath the sea as
a statue guardian of the prison, and will return to herald the rebirth of
Creation when she is needed most. In others, Daana'd escapes from the Underworld
and reaches unity with the Water Dragon.

### Daana'd's Purviews and Mystery Cults

Daana'd is the dragon of water, and thus naturally associated with sailors,
fisherfolk, boatmakers, beachcombers, and others who make their living by water.
Extending from her position as patron of sailors, Daana'd is also the protector
of all travelers, especially travelers-by-night.

Daana'd is also known as the Remover of Obstacles, a sacred figure who can be
invoked in times of hardship for devotion and strength. In times of injustice,
Daana'd is invoked as the Arbiter and defender. Lastly, Daana'd is also the
dragon of transitions, who guards the shore, represents transgender individuals,
and oversees the change of things from one state to the next.

Daana'd rivals Sextes Jylis as the most widely-worshipped of the dragons, with
peasant cults dedicated to her located in almost all villages and towns. As a
righteous and beloved hero, remover of obstacles, and defender of the weak, she
is especially worshipped in hard times. Peasants often believe that invoking
Daana'd can bring rain in times of drought and liberation in times of bondage.

Mystery cults of Daana'd are widespread, often emphasizing her trickster
nature. These cults often find secret wisdom in the Schooling of Samwat and the
Younger and Descending epics. Criminals often revere Daana'd as well, due to her
trickster nature. Many members of the criminal element have a tattoo of Daana'd
or aquatic imagery in her honor.

Common syncretizations of Daana'd include: Daana'd Wayfarer, syncretized with
gods of travel or the maiden Mercury of the House of Journeys; Daana'd of a
Thousand Faces, syncretized with gods of night, the moon, trickster spirits, and
criminal gods; and the Ashen Lady, who watches over the long, dark sail across
the seas of the dead.

### Emulation of Daana'd

Immaculates are encouraged to emulate Daana'd by bending without breaking, by
being clever and quick, by being devoted and righteous, and by being
self-sustaining and persistent.

Water Aspects are encouraged to emulate Daana'd by retaining their focus. Water
has no shape, but instead takes on the shape of its vessel; it has no
boundaries, but flows around obstacles. Often, Water Aspects can find themselves
adrift, pulled in many shapes by their flows. Daana'd reminds them to focus on
what is important, and to define their own shapes.
