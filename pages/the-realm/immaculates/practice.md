# A Brief Glance at Immaculate Practice

Immaculacy can be divided into many branches, but the largest and most important
branch is the Immaculate Philosophy, the branch recognized by the Scarlet
Empress as the state religion of her Realm.

The Immaculate Philosophy can be divided into many different _lineages_, defined
as a set of practices and beliefs which share a recognized canon, share rituals
originating from the same _sacred manuals_, and recognize the same historical
lineage of its priests. On the Blessed Isle, the most widespread lineage is the
_Rainbow Gate of Wisdom_ lineage. The second-most prominent is the _Earth and_
_Heaven Harmonious Orthodox_ lineage, mostly practiced by the Tepet territories.

This section will present a brief overview of some practices of the Rainbow Gate
of Wisdom lineage and some of its non-practical traditions.

## Physical Wellness

The Order teaches that spiritual and physical wellness are deeply connected to
one another. Because of this, they encourage all followers to take a few
moments every day to stretch and practice a sacred form. These physical routines
have been carefully designed over centuries to promote good health and increase
the cultivation of positive energy in the body.

For Dynasts, these routines are focused on genuine martial practice, serving as
a reminder that all Dragon-Blooded are warriors in some capacity. Many of these
sacred forms focus on the use of weaponry and serve as a practical grounding in
the techniques that the Legions use to drill their soldiers and the Order uses
to teach martial arts. These routines also encourage free Essence flows through
the body.

For peasants, these routines are simpler and focused on breath. The breath is a
powerful manifestation of the soul and good breathing improves your spiritual
energy. Monks often suggest certain sacred forms to perform in the morning,
with the goal of aligning the body's energy to the work of the day.

### A Daily Routine of a Prince of the Earth: Morning Exercises

Cathak Wren wakes up in the morning and starts her day with her morning
exercises. She performs several katas with her sword, moving through three of
the sacred forms. After that, she practices with shield, through three other
sacred forms. She spars with her partner and then refreshes herself.

Morningflower wakes up in the morning with her family. She, her sister, and
their mother take a few moments to stretch and move through the sacred form that
the monk gave them -- he said it would bring them more energy during the day.
It also helps Mother and her old joints, so she insists on doing them daily.

## Household Shrines

Almost all Immaculate households maintain a household (or family) shrine. This
sacred space is a focus of spiritual energy and an anchor point for meditation
practices.

A household shrine is composed of many parts, but the most major are the
lineage stone, the cultivation bowl, the incense dish, the noisemakers, and the
offering tray. Family shrines are usually strictly forbidden from featuring
conography of any kind, although Dynastic shrines -- often consecrated as a
temple by a monk of the Order -- frequently feature iconography of the Five
Immaculate Dragons.

The **lineage stone** represents Earth and the connection between the
practitioner and all of their ancestors and fellow practitioners. In many
shrines, the lineage stone is a smooth, round stone polished to a glistening
sheen and carved with the characters for "rainbow gate," "wisdom," "virtue," or
other such positive sentiments. In temples and more luxurious households, the
lineage stones are often slabs carved with many records tracing the family's
spiritual heritage through generations, the important dates of the calendar,
and more.

The **cultivation bowl** represents Water and the practitioner's soul. The bowl
is usually a small metal bowl with a pleasant pattern, although in the shrines
of wealthier families with larger shrines, it is often a very big bowl with a
pleasant pattern. The water in the cultivation bowl is infused with positive
energy from meditations performed at the shrine, and is used for a variety of
purposes during meditations and in cleaning the shrine.

The **incense dish** represents Fire, unsurprisingly. Burning incense is often
used as a concentration aid during meditations and as part of infusing the whole
space with the shrine's energy. Many shrines have candles and lanterns as part
of their arrangement, but they must always feature a dish for receiving incense.

The **noisemakers** represent Air and the outside world. These might be chimes,
bells, a drum, or any other small and convenient noisemaker. During meditations,
the practitioner uses the noisemaker to set a rhythm for their chants and to
signal the beginning and end of verses. This not only builds a clear pattern
focus for your energy, but also transfers the energy of the shrine to the
outside world, sharing the good fortune with all.

The **offering tray** represents Wood and is usually a flat slab of wood used
to present offerings at the shrine. Offerings fulfill a variety of purposes. On
days for which there is no calendrical worship, the offering serves as a
reminder of abandoning attachment to physical goods. On days when the calendar
specifies worship, the offering is dedicated to the god receiving that day's
worship. Offerings usually include fruits and vegetables, a convenient
representation of Wood nature.

The duty of tending to the household shrine is traditionally assigned to the
oldest child of the youngest generation living in the house, as long as they are
old enough to perform their duties respectfully. The tedium of this chore is
often a bonding point for children from pious families.

### A Daily Routine of a Prince of the Earth: Maintaing the Household Shrine

As the oldest child of the youngest generation still living at the compound, it
is Cathak Wren's duty to maintain the family shrine. On this compound, the
shrine is a sizeable pagoda near the entrance to the gardens.

Cathak Wren gathers up her servants and heads to the shrine. The lineage tablet
stands at the rear of the shrine, up against the far wall. The floor is rattan
mats arranged in lucky patterns. The space is spotless.

First, she makes her way to the cultivation bowl, a huge brass basin to the
left of the lineage tablet. The household servants have made sure that the bowl
is full of fresh water. Cathak Wren performs a standing meditation to cultivate
positive energy, and releases it into the water. Now prepared, she washes her
hands, making sure not to drip back into the basin, and the servants do the
same.

The next step is to prepare the lineage tablet. It is a huge black marble
tablet, taller than she is, with silver engravings tracing the heritage of her
family's spirituality back to Master Rain. She and the servants use the prepared
water to clean the stone so that it shines.

She then lights the coiling incense snake to the right of the lineage stone,
making sure to arrange the incense dish beneath to catch the ashes. Today's
incense was prepared in the far-off satrapy of Astragal and smells sweet and
fresh.

She consults the open calendar scroll on the table in front of the shrine, and
notes the gods being revered today. She cross-references their names with the
offering notes in the sacred manuals, and has the servants gather up the
required fruits and vegetables. She arranges them carefully on the offering tray
in accordance with the specified geometries and sets the tray on the protrusion
before the lineage stone.

She has now prepared the shrine and is ready for the morning meditation.

### A Daily Routine of a Peasant: Maintaining the Household Shrine

As the oldest child of the youngest generation still living in her home, it is
Morningflower's duty to maintain the family shrine. It is located in the corner
of the kitchen, standing on a little table with a mat on the floor in front of
it. She removes the cat from sleeping on the mat and brushes it clean.

Morningflower starts by taking the cultivation bowl and filling it with water
from the pitcher she keeps under the shrine. The bowl is actually a drinking
cup that her father acquired in the big city before he passed away; they make
sure that no one's lips have ever touched it. She rushes through a standing
meditation.

Her family's lineage stone is a pretty gray riverstone that has been handed down
in her mother's family for many generations. It was originally shaped and
blessed by Abbot Cherry herself, the old old Dragon-Blood who tends the central
shrine in the big city. It is an ancient relic touched directly by a Prince of
the Earth and one of the most valuable things her family owns. She dips her
fingers into the cultivation bowl and sprinkles a couple drops of water onto
the lineage stone.

She takes a stick of incense and lights it in the hearthfire, cupping her hand
beneath to catch the ash. This incense was made by the local incense-maker, and
smells a little off; it might be getting old. She places it in the little
circular incense stone.

Lastly, she grabs an apple from her family's meager pantry and a small scoop of
rice. She puts the apple on the offering board and arranges the rice in a little
pile next to it. Mother gets very annoyed if the offerings don't look pretty.
