# Temples and Monastics

The Immaculate house of worship is called the _temple_. Where the family shrine
is the focus of spirituality for the individual, the temple is the focus of
spirituality for the community. Temples serve not only as places to hold
ceremonies and lectures, but also as centers for community activity.

Immaculate faithful are called to attend temples regularly and frequently. The
temple is the beating heart of the local Immaculate community, and the main
place in which the faithful are able to interact formally with the monks. Monks
often leave the temple grounds to invest themselves in the community, so it is
not the _only_ place to encounter them, but all threads of faith lead back to
the temple.

Monks are the formal clergy of the Immaculate Order, those who have given up
their material life in order to pursue a spiritual one. For many Immaculates,
the presence of monks is ubiquitous. If a temple is nearby, then there are monks
there, who offer frequent wisdom, insight, and suggestions for moral life. Even
in the most remote villages, monks sometimes come to visit, bringing wisdom and
advice.

The Order is devoted to ensuring that every devout Immaculate, no matter their
far-flung location, has access, even if only occasionally, to the wisdom of the
Order and guidance on their spiritual affairs. All monks are empowered to make
decisions based on the Texts and offer advice on personal affairs. When a
community loses a monk to death or her retirement to a monastery, there is great
sadness, for the community has not only lost a leader, but also a close friend
and confidant -- sometimes of many generations.
