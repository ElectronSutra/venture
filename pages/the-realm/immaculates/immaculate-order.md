# The Immaculate Order

The Immaculate Philosophy is the state religion of the Realm, and the spiritual
practice in which you were all raised. The clergy of this religion are known as
the Immaculate Order.

The Immaculate Order is basically fantasy Buddhism crossed with Indian Orthodoxy
with a healthy sprinkle of proselytizing and social control.

## High-Level Summary

Here's what you need to know about the Immaculate Philosophy in order to play
your character as someone who practices it:

- The Dragon-Blooded are in charge. This is natural and good.
- There are 5 mythical figures of virtue who everyone should strive to emulate.
- Practitioners shouldn't worship gods directly; leave that to the monks.
- There are these things called Anathema that try to stray people from the Path.
  It is the sacred duty of all Princes of the Earth to make sure that doesn't
  happen.

## Core Beliefs

The heart of Immaculate belief is the Perfected Hierarchy. The Order teaches
that all human beings exist within a natural and perfect hierarchy. Everybody is
born with a sacred duty, and the goal of life is to fulfill your duty. The
farmer's lot is to farm; the monk's lot is to pray; the Dragon-Blooded's lot is
to rule.

By living in accordance with their sacred duty, the individual is blessed with
good merit, good fortune, and good luck. When they pass on, their accumulated
merit advances them along the path to spiritual enlightenment. Thus, in their
next life, they are born into a more perfect step.

In the end, the individual accumulates enough merit to transcend the cycle of
rebirth and reunify their soul with the Elemental Dragons. Becoming a Prince of
the Earth is the last step in this cycle; they're the humans that are in closest
alignment to the Elemental Dragons.

The Order teaches that mortals should _not_ worship gods directly, because this
leads the soul astray. Instead, mortals should focus on personal betterment and
fulfilling their duty, and allow the Order to coordinate divine worship.

## Dragons and Dragons and More Dragons

The world was created by the five Elemental Dragons, who also created humanity
from their souls. Humans, an imperfect subset of the souls of the dragons, are
subject to impurity and temptation; the goal of the Order is to liberate
yourself from your human attachments and reunify your soul with the dragons.

Also of vital importance are the Five Immaculate Dragons, five Dragon-Blooded
heroes of ancient times. These five soldier-messiahs liberated the world from
the tyranny of the Anathema and wrote the original texts which the Order has
preserved to this day.

## The Five Immaculate Dragons

The Five Immaculate Dragons who defeated the Anathema of the Realm Before and
wrote the original texts are:

- **Mela**, the Dragon of Air, Petitioner of Clouds Accordant to the Call of
  Battle. Mela was the first of the Five Immaculate Dragons to incarnate.
  She was a devoted soldier and deeply involved in her community; she teaches us
  the value of Engagement.
- **Sextes Jylis**, the Dragon of Wood, He Who Hath Strewn Much Grass. Sextes
  Jylis wandered the world bringing grain, livestock, and prosperity to everyone
  he encountered. He never lost sight of the important things: the virtue of
  Duty.
- **Daana'd**, the Dragon of Water, the Arbiter of the Immaculate Complaint.
  Daana'd was born as a man before she gave up her life and her beard to join
  the Immaculate Dragons. When the Dragons made war on the Anathema, she swam
  down to the darkest depths to ensure that none escaped justice. She teaches us
  the value of Devotion.
- **Pasiap**, the Dragon of Earth, He Who Illuminates Both Worlds With Majesty
  and Power. Pasiap was the educator of the Dragons, and the most knowledgeable
  of the Anathema. He was second in command after Mela. Pasiap devoted his life
  to education and mercy. He teaches us the value of Compassion.
- **Hesiesh**, the Dragon of Fire, the Reciter of Loud Hymns and Efficacious
  Prayers. Hesiesh was the most powerful of the Dragons, but spent his whole
  life carefully cultivating his power for when he needed it most. When the
  Dragons made war on the Anathema, he unleased his full power as a firestorm
  that swept the world clean. Hesiesh teaches us the value of Self-Control.

The Order teaches that the way to lead your best life is to emulate the five
Immaculate Dragons in action and in thought.

## Anathema

The Order terms anything that would lead their flock astray as _Anathema_. In
this label, we find everything from the gold and silver demons of the Realm
Before who enslaved humanity, to raksha and fair folk preying on dreams, to gods
who demand worship and shun the calendar.

The Order occasionally organizes a "Wyld Hunt" to deal with a pressing problem
of Anathema. You are aware of this obligation -- if you are called, you must
answer. However, mostly the Order calls on its own monks, so it's a distant
possibility.
