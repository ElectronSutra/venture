    <p>
        In the city of Myion on the Isle's southwest coast, red-haired Cathak soldiers
        march in lockstep through the stony alleyways and flying buttresses. In the
        Fortress of the Greatest General overlooking the city, a commander shouts orders
        and her hundred soldiers obey, lifting red-tasseled spears in a game of war.

    <p>
        House Cathak is the Realm's military juggernaut, rivaled only by House Tepet in
        its devotion to the glory of the Imperial Legions. The Cathak families are known
        for their ambition and their martial streak; only a rare Cathak daughter makes
        it through her life without serving in the Legions.
    </p>

    {{ macros.h2("Why play a Cathak?") }}

    <p>
        House Cathak is all about <i>ambition</i>. Cathaks are never satisfied. Play a Cathak
        if you want to hail from a family with a glorious military history, or if you
        want to explore the conflict between your individual ambitions and your loyalty
        to your military and House.
    </p>

    {{ macros.h2("Cathak Culture") }}

    <p>
        Driven by matriarch Cathak Cainan and his family, the Cathak are intensely
        religious, embracing the martial tradition of the Immaculate Order. Pragmatism
        and insight are key traits for surviving a Cathak childhood. House Cathak
        values <b>victory</b> and <b>ambition</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Legions are the beating heart of House Cathak. They value military service
        and public honor above other virtues. They tend to be direct and pious. They
        thrive on competition and do not accept mediocrity.
    </p>
