# House Nellens

## The Dragons of the Blood Resurgent

![Nellens Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/nellens.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

The senator Nellens was a fiery advocate, a rare mortal allowed into the Upper
Chamber of the Deliberative. Many expected he would be censured by the Empress
for speaking out against his betters, the Dragon-Blooded senators he ought to
bow to. Instead, the Empress took him as her lover. Centuries after he died, she
founded a House in his honor -- an insult to the rest of the Dynasty that the
other Houses have never forgotten.

House Nellens fights every day to survive. The only House in the Realm's history
to be raised in honor of a mortal, it has struggled for the past two centuries
to earn the respect due to its station. Nellens has taken every chance it can
get to advance. Their worldview is summarized in a proverb they quote: "If a
woman is your enemy, you just haven't found the right leverage."

## Why Play a Nellens?

House Nellens is all about the struggles of _identity_. They straddle two
worlds, the patriciate and the Dynasty, and are fully accepted by neither. Play
a Nellens if you want to be clever and mercantile; if you want to be scrappy and
ambitious; or if you want to have a unique relationship to parts of the country
the rest of the Dynasty often overlook.

## Nellens Culture

Nellens children grow up being called _mongrel_, _thin-blooded_, and _fraud_.
Every Nellens is quick, but above all they are scrappy. The House is very
diverse, valuing whatever members it can add to its roster. They thrive on
marriage contracts, never granting a marriage without careful review by the
House's leadership. Nellens is the only House to devote itself to a good
relationship with the patriciate, and the House which owes the least debt to
House Ragara.

## What Does Your Character Know?

Nellens characters have a greater awareness of the following topics:

- You have a broad awareness of politics in the few Nellens holdings. You can
  name the major figures, their duties, and their allegiances.
- Your childhood involved careful study of markets and money. You know the
  imports and exports of all regions of the Isle, as well as the basics theory
  of economics and trade. You have specialist knowledge of an industry of your
  choice: textiles, salt trade, mining, etc.
- You grew up surrounded by peers that the other Houses overlook: the
  patriciate. You can name all the major patrician families, their important
  figures, and their allegiances. You know how to mediate between the desires
  of the patriciate and the needs of the Dynasty.
- You have an instinct for families and lineages. Whenever you meet a prominent
  figure, you know their lineage and important relatives. You have an
  encyclopedic knowledge of the pedigree of all Nellens' major families.
