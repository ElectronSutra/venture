# House Cynis

![Cynis Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/cynis.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

The tangled eaves and leafy boughs of the House of Trees rise up above the port
of Pangu; inside, hookah smoke hangs heavy over the scattered bottle remnants of
a great party. Cynis scions look out over the city and admire the foreigners
coming and going. Below, the markets churn with herbs, drugs, slaves, and other
luxuries; on every corner, a Cynis keeps careful watch.

House Cynis is decadent and sensual. They do not simply party -- they throw
_galas_ that last for weeks, with feasts that make kings weep with envy. They
have their fingers in every luxurious pie, trading in the fineries that the
Dynasty so desperately longs for. But only a fool would think them ineffectual
-- Cynis' focus is on soft power, and every Dynast knows that all the
indiscretions at that Cynis party will come back to haunt them as blackmail.

## Why Play a Cynis?

House Cynis is all about _materialism_. Your House thrives on the exploitation
of human beings -- on slavery, blackmail, drugs, and trafficking. Play a Cynis
if you want to live a life of hedonism, to wield soft power like a knife, or
if you want to explore the conflict between your personal code and your family's
decadent lifestyle.

## Cynis Culture

Cynis scions focus on politics and backroom deals rather than overt shows of
force. They are subtle, sexy, and sly; everything they do, they do to excess.
Cynis values perfection above all else. Sometimes it is perfection of form, and
sometimes of talent, but Cynis has no place for the ugly or the broken.

Cynis Dragon-Blooded are known for having plenty of affairs. Most quote the old
proverb, "Marriage is for children, love is for pleasure." Many of the other
Houses underestimate Cynis, and Cynis happily allows them to, all the while
readying the next knife in their back.

## What Do You Know?

Cynis characters have a greater awareness of the following topics:

- You are intimately familiar with the politics of the Cynis lands. You know all
  the major players by name and face, as well as their duties, allegiances,
  and their families.
- Your childhood lessons emphasized soft power and networking. You know all the
  important figures from all the Houses, as well as their duties and the general
  status of the other House's political interests.
- You grew up in a world of pillows and knives. You know all the major poisons
  by smell and taste, as well as some secret ones. You know basic medicine and
  simple herbalism.
- You have an instinct for fashion and trends. You know all the current styles,
  and which are pass√©; which perfumes to wear, and so on.
