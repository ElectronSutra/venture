# House Mnemon

## The Earth Carved in the Image of One

![Mnemon Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/mnemon.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

From her palace atop a pyramid at the center of mountainous Mnemon-Darjilis, the
matriarch Mnemon looks out over the marmoreal towers and skybridges of the city
that bears her name. Iron rings out on iron, and bursts of light from ancient
things spike over the city. A monk rings a bell to call the folk to prayer and
incense floats on the breeze. Mnemon is happy, and proud of her work.

House Mnemon is the exact, precise product of the efforts of the matriarch
Mnemon, exactly as she wants it to be. More than any other matriarch, Mnemon
_designed_ her House. Devoted to the industry and construction that its leader
is so passionate for, House Mnemon is everywhere, building temples, collecting
power, and advancing the passions of its beautiful, arrogant mother...

## Why Play a Mnemon?

House Mnemon is all about _hubris_. The entire House is defined by the artist's
ego and the passion of the auteur. Play a Mnemon if you want to be devout and
creative, or if you want to explore the conflict between your House's lust for
power and status and your own ambitions.

## Mnemon Culture

House Mnemon is both publicly and privately the most devout House, even moreso
than Ledaal and Cathak. They are famously well-educated, and value creativity
and pride. Unusually among the Dynasty, House Mnemon promotes close and loving
relationships between mother and daughter, and encourages sibling-sibling bonds.
Many Mnemon spend significant chunks of time in the satrapies, giving the House
a unique and exotic air. House Mnemon _hates_ House Ragara.
