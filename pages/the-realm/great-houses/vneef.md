# House V'neef

## The Wood That Tenders the Garden's Grace

The elevation of House V'neef is _the_ most important single change to Realm
politics to happen within the past century, displacing even the destruction of
House Iselsi. Elevated to Great House status only 25 years ago, House V'neef is
only now beginning to produce homegrown adults; most of the House has been
assembled by marriages, adoption, and bringing foreigners into the fold.

V'neef was awarded the imperial monopoly on the Merchant Fleet, stealing that
out from under House Peleps. V'neef dominates the Realm's markets of wine and
luxury goods, making them rivals to House Cynis. The sorceress-matriarch Mnemon
herself personally despises V'neef for being the Empress' current favorite. The
list of grievances goes on and on.

V'neef was only 31 when her House was elevated -- even Mnemon did not get a
Great House until she was nearly 70. House V'neef is young, desperate, scrappy,
and eager. Only the future will tell what they can become.

## Why Play a V'neef?

House V'neef is all about _growth_. This House is completely unique for allowing
you to play a major role in a Great House establishing itself. You should play
a V'neef if you want to be scrappy and hounded by rivals on all sides; if you
want to have a unique background and family culture; or if you want to examine
the conflict between your duty to grow your House and your own goals in life.

## V'neef Culture

V'neef is young and fresh enough that it has not yet established a strong
internal culture. The House is strongly guided by V'neef herself and her husband
V'neef Igan _n√©_ Tepet. V'neef is respected even by her rivals as a driven,
dynamic leader as beautiful and fearsome as her mother. In its twenty-five years
of life, House V'neef has adopted hundreds of patrician Dragon-Blooded and
foreign lost eggs, leading to an exciting mish-mash of traditions. Many of
V'neef's adopted children are older than she is.

## What Do You Know?

V'neef characters have a greater awareness of the following topics:

- You are intimately familiar with the politics of the V'neef holdings. You know
  the names, positions, and allegiances of all the major players. Likewise, you
  are well-informed of the goings-on of the Merchant Fleet.
- Your childhood was probably partially under the tutelage of another House. Are
  you one of the first trueborn V'neef? Or were you brought into the House by
  marriage or adoption? You have a background that fits your original House, or
  you can define it if you are a true-born V'neef.
- You have studied the workings of the Merchant Fleet. You know the basics of
  trade and exchange, as well as the major imports and exports of the Realm's
  satrapies abroad. You have probably spent a chunk of time in the   West, where
  most of the Fleet's operations are focused -- you know the basics of sailing
  blue water and operating abroad.
- You are extremely knowledgeable about _wine_, the House's lifeblood. You can
  tell vintages and terroir with a simple sip. You know the names and locations
  of all major vineyards on the Isle and a few abroad. You know the names and
  prestige of all major vintages. You know the names and specialties of the
  Isle's master vintners and their seals. You can tell a fraudulent wine with
  a simple whiff.
