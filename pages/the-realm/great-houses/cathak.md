# House Cathak

![Cathak Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/cathak.png)

In the city of Myion on the Isle's southwest coast, red-haired Cathak soldiers
march in lockstep through the stoney alleyways and flying buttresses. In the
Fortress of the Greatest General overlooking the city, a commander shouts orders
and her hundred soldiers obey, lifting red-tassled spears in a game of war.

House Cathak is the Realm's military juggernaut, rivaled only by House Tepet in
its devotion to the glory of the Imperial Legions. The Cathak families are known
for their ambition and their martial streak; only a rare Cathak daughter makes
it through her life without serving in the Legions.

## Why Play a Cathak?

House Cathak is all about _ambition_. Cathaks are never satisfied. Play a Cathak
if you want to hail from a family with a glorious military history, or if you
want to explore the conflict between your individual ambitions and your loyalty
to your military and House.

## Cathak Culture

Driven by matriarch Cathak Cainan and his family, the Cathak are intensely
religious, embracing the martial tradition of the Immaculate Order. Pragmatism
and insight are key traits for surviving a Cathak childhood.

The Legions are the beating heart of House Cathak. They value military service
and public honor above other virtues. They tend to be direct and pious. They
thrive on competition and do not accept mediocrity.
