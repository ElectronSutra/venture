# 20 Questions

What kind of character do you want to play? What is your history? What are your
beliefs and traditions?

The Realm is a society which is often dissimilar to our own. This process is
designed to guide you through a series of leading questions to help you build a
character that fits within the Realm. Your answers will guide you to create a
character that _belongs_ in Creation.

## Section I: The Broad Strokes

These questions define your character in broad terms. These answers will inform,
but not restrict, your answers to later questions.

### 1. What Great House raised you?

The dragons of the Realm mostly belong to the ten Great Houses. Each House is a
heroic lineage that stretches back to a legendary founder. Your House raised
you; your world is rooted in the world your House showed you.

When choosing your House, you should choose whichever House you find interesting
or whichever has a suite of themes you want to engage with. Each House will have
a different set of expectations and habits that it imposed on you as a child. It
is up to you whether you live up to them or rail against them.

Choose one of the following Great Houses which you were raised in:

- [**House Cathak**.](/the-realm/great-houses/cathak/) A military house famed
  for brilliant tacticians and powerful Legions.
- [**House Cynis**.](/the-realm/great-houses/cynis/) A luxurious and decadent
  House with a reputation for debauchery and intrigue.
- [**House Ledaal**.](/the-realm/great-houses/ledaal/) A zealous and traditional
  House devoted to upholding the social order.
- [**House Mnemon**.](/the-realm/great-houses/mnemon/) A proud, devout House
  with a deeply-involved guiding hand.
- [**House Nellens**.](/the-realm/great-houses/nelens/) A scrappy House of
  mongrels and thin-bloods.
- [**House Peleps**.](/the-realm/great-houses/peleps/) A beloved House of folk
  heroes charged with maintaining the Imperial Navy.
- [**House Ragara**.](/the-realm/great-houses/ragara/) An obscenely wealthy
  House of bankers and merchants with a finger in every pie.
- [**House Sesus**.](/the-realm/great-houses/sesus/) A secretive military House
  with a reputation for spycraft and deviousness.
- [**House Tepet**.](/the-realm/great-houses/tepet/) An ancient military House
  with a warrior tradition older than the Realm itself.
- [**House V'neef**.](/the-realm/great-houses/vneef/) An upstart House, less
  than 60 years old, trying to bust its way onto the stage.

**Define** at least one Intimacy related to your House. How do you feel about
your House? About its reputation? Do you live up to your family's expectations,
or do you defy their commands? Are you proud of your House? Embarassed? Does
your House embrace you as a success or alienate you as an embarassment?

### 2. What is your Aspect?

Every Dragon-Blood reflects all five elements in their soul. At the same time,
each Prince of the Earth feels a particular element more strongly than her
sisters. This element is your _Aspect_; it reflects your nature and informs your
legend.

Choose which of the five elements you resonate with the most:

- [**Air**.](/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#air/) Air is subtle and clever,
  but distant and cold.
- [**Earth**.](/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#earth/) Earth is enduring and
  wise, but conservative and stubborn.
- [**Fire**.](/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#fire/) Fire is hot and
  powerful, but impulsive and dangerous.
- [**Water**.](/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#water/) Water is flexible and
  insightful, but duplicitous and malleable.
- [**Wood**.](/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#wood/) Wood is lively and
  persistent, but hedonistic and venomous.

Having selected your Aspect, mark your five Aspect Abilities. In Lot Casting
Atemi, they will be automatically filled-in when you select your Aspect. You
get one free dot in each of these five Abilities.

**Consider** how your Aspect influences your personality. All dragons reflect
their element in some way; or perhaps their element reflects them. In the notes
section of your character sheet, write down at least one personality trait and
one physical trait that reflect your Aspect.

## Section II: Skills and Education

Your character has both natural aptitudes and learned skills. In this section,
we will walk through your innate talents, your education, and your professional
life.

### 3. In what ways did you stand out among your peers?

Which of the following statements do you agree with the most? Which do you agree
with the least?

> I was physically superior; I was stronger, faster, or more durable.

> I was socially superior; I was more charismatic, more wily, or more sensual.

> I was mentally superior; I was more perceptive, more intelligent, or wittier.

The statement you agree with most defines your _primary_ Attributes. The
statement you agree with second-most unsurprisingly defines your _secondary_
Attributes. The statement you agree with the least defins your _tertiary_
Attributes.

Every Attribute begins with 1 dot for free, congratulations. Now **distribute**
8 more dots among your primary Attributes, 6 more dots among your secondary
Attributes, and 4 more dots among your tertiary attributes.

**Define** at least one self-reflective Intimacy that relates to your
Attributes. If you have high Strength but low Intelligence, perhaps you consider
yourself a stupid brute; etc.

### 4. What secondary school did you attend and how did you stand out?

As an exceptional scion of one of the Great Houses, you were lucky enough to be
able to attend one of the Realm's great secondary schools. You almost certainly
had very little say in _which one_; your family probably arranged it as soon as
you were born.

Choose one of the following options for where you attended your secondary
school:

- [**The Cloister of Wisdom**](/the-realm/schools#the-cloister-of-wisdom).
  You were sent to the Cloister of Wisdom, a monastery and school all at once.
  While there, you learned the virtues of clarity, tranquility, and purpose.
  About half your classmates went on to become monks.
- [**The Heptagram**](/the-realm/schools#the-heptagram). You were sent to the
  distant freezing Isle of Voices to study at the Heptagram, _the_ premier
  academy of sorcery and mysticism. You were taught the values of wisdom,
  fortitude, and drive, and set down the lonely path of the sorcerer.
- [**The House of Bells**](/the-realm/schools#the-house-of-bells). You were
  sent to the House of Bells; there is no finer military academy anywhere in
  Creation! You were drilled in the virtues of courage, strength, and
  discipline. You served for a time in the Legions or Navy as a commissioned
  officer and probably have plenty of war stories.
- [**The Spiral Academy**](/the-realm/schools#the-spiral-academy). The Academy
  teaches one rule, and well: You cannot rule without understanding what you
  rule. At the Academy, you were instructed in the virtues of knowledge,
  subtlety, and precision. You probably entered the bureaucracy,. and
  likely a handful of your schoolmates went on to be spies.
- [**Pasiap's Stair**](/the-realm/schools#pasiaps-stair). Uh oh, you made a big
  fucky; or, you were really brave. The Stair is a military academy, but it's
  not like the comfortable life at the House of Bells; no no, the Stair is an
  unforgiving march with no comfort and no mercy, only glory. You are
  well-acquainted with your many foreign schoolmates.

**Consider** how you stood out at school; were you especially studious, or
maybe unusually good at dueling? Pick 5 Abilities that you excel at; they
cannot be the same 5 as your Aspect. Mark them on your sheet as _favored_. You
get 1 free dot in each.

### 5. What skills have you acquired during your life?

You have acquired skills from your time in primary school, your time in
secondary school, and your adult life. What are those skills?

**Distribute** 20 additional dots, however you choose, among _all_ the Abilities
on your character sheet. Think about your time as an adult and your prior
experiences to inform your skills. Perhaps you learned field medicine to justify
your points in Medicine, and so forth.

In answering this question, you cannot raise any Ability above 3 dots.

### 6. What areas have you specialized in?

You have specialties in several skills; these are important because they
increase the power of some of your Charms.

Based on your secondary school, **choose** two of the three listed Abilities to
gain a Specialty. Remember, you must have at least 1 dot in an Ability to have
a specialty in it.

- If you attended the **Cloister of Wisdom**, choose two specialties from among:
  Integrity, Lore, Martial Arts.
- If you attended the **Heptagram**, choose two specialties from among:
  Craft, Lore, Occult.
- If you attended the **House of Bells**, choose two specialties from among:
  Archery, Melee, War.
- If you attended the **Spiral Academy**, choose two specialties from among:
  Bureaucracy, Presence, Socialize.
- If you attended **Pasiap's Stair**, choose two specialties from among:
  Athletics, Resistance, War.

Then, **choose** three more skills to receive a Specialty.

## Section III: Duty and Ambition

You are a scion of the mightiest empire in the world. You are neither idle nor
satisfied; you have duties, and you desire something more. This section will
help you determine them.

### 7. Who do you owe a duty to and what is your duty?

You have not made it to adult life without acquiring attachments. You owe your
time and energy to someone or something -- not just owe, but _want_ to owe. This
is a burden you have _chosen_ to take on -- or you have chosen is your least bad
option.

**Choose** who you owe a duty to. Are you employed, and owe your time to your
career? Are you a monk, and owe your duty to your faith and abbot? Have you
taken on a duty from your House, and owe it to your family?

**Choose** your duty. Here are some examples of duties you might choose
to take on:

- You are a minister. You have joined the bureaucracy and are part of the
  execution of government. You owe a duty to "the Realm."
- You are a Legionnaire. You are a career soldier, and have served overseas in
  enforcing the will of the Empress. You now take up arms on the Isle, hunting
  down bandits and subduing rebellions. You owe a duty to "the Legions."
- You are a monk. You have eschewed personal wealth and even your own name, and
  devoted yourself to the spiritual. You owe a duty to "the Immaculate Order."
- You are a spy. Your family has given you a cover -- something harmless, but
  that lets you get around. You gather up secrets and feed them back to your
  House, or to the highest bidder. You owe a duty to "your House."

And so on and so forth. Whatever you choose, your duty should be both active and
flexible.

**Define** a Tie related to the person or organization that you owe your duty.

**Define** a Principle that reflects your duty.

One of those two should be at least a Major Intimacy.

### 8. What do you deeply desire, and how does it conflict with your duty?

The Princes of the Earth are greedy bastards, to a one. Oh sure, some of them
become monks, and some of them are good people, but all of them _want_
something. They all have a _goal_.

Your goal is something that you will fight for that is not your duty. In fact,
a good goal _conflicts_ with your duty, at least occasionally. The simple fact
that you _want_ A but _have to do_ B can drive a pretty compelling story.

Your goal and your duty don't have to always conflict, but they should at least
sometimes. To define your goal, ask yourself: what do I want so badly that I
will abandon my duty and possibly screw over my own people in order to get it?

As with your duty, a good goal is both active and flexible.

**Define** an Intimacy that expresses your goal. It should be at least Major.

### 9. What is your relationship to your family?

You already have an Intimacy related to your House. For this question, you
should think more about your specific _family_.

Most parents in the Realm are distant. Loving your child is neither expected nor
looked down upon; but raising a weak one is. Were your parents close or distant?
Did you have a favored sibling or beloved nanny? Do you resent your family, or
do you love them? Both?

Are you married? Do you have children? Both of these are important expectations
of Dynastic life.

**Define** at least one Intimacy related to a family member. **Consider** if you
have a spouse or any children -- make note of them on your character sheet.

## Section IV: History

This section will guide you in defining your character's history and legend
up to this point.

### 10. What advantages have you accumulated in life?

Every character has a suite of [_Merits_](/character-creation/merits), which
represent your advantages. Check out the Merits section for the complete list.

**Distribute** 13 dots of merits however you like. Then, you get 5 more dots
to distribute among Backing, Command, Contacts, Followers, Influence, Language,
Resources and Retainers, to represent your privileged position in society. That
is a total of 18 points of Merits.

### 11. What is your greatest accomplishment so far?

What is the thing you have accomplished that you are most proud of? **Consider**
your greatest achievement so far, and make a note of it on your character sheet.

This should probably tie in to your Merits -- maybe it involves your Command, or
you were able to accomplish it because of your Backing.

### 12. What is your worst failure so far?

Nothing stays up forever. You've failed before, and you've failed hard. Tell
us about it!

**Consider** what your biggest failure was, and write it on your character
sheet. Did you develop an Intimacy because of it? Does it tie in to your Merits?

## Section V: Personality and Behavior

We're almost there. We've finished with the numbers for now, and we're on to the
broad strokes of your personality -- who you are as a person.

### 13. What is your character's greatest virtue?

What virtue does your character embody? Try to think of virtues in terms of the
Realm, not in terms of American society. For example, individualism is a virtue
for most Americans, but the Realm does not value it in the same way as, say,
filial piety or obedient execution of duty.

**Define** an Intimacy that is related to your virtue. Or, **consider** how your
character embodies this virtue and reflect on how it manifests in their
behavior.

### 14. What is your character's heroic flaw?

All good legends need a flaw. Greek heroes had their hubris, Sherlock his
addiction, House his hatred of humans... Scooby and Shaggy their voracious
hunger.

**Define** an Intimacy that is related to your vice. Your flaw is ideally
something as broad as "misanthropy" or "hubris," so that it can be relevant in
different ways at different times.

**Define** some trinket or item you have that reflects your flaw -- a gambler
may carry dice, hubris may be indicated by your collection of trophies, etc.

### 15. What do people notice first when they meet you?

What do people notice first when they meet you? This may be something like your
piercing eyes or animal magnetism. You might also consider something like how
you are underdressed for your station, or how you always wear armor even while
you should be safe.

What stands out about you may also be your _reputation_. If you defy the norm
for your House, people may notice that about you, and your reputation will
precede you when meeting new people.

**Consider** what it is that stands out about you, and note it on your character
sheet in the Notes section. It's a good detail to throw in if you are trying to
make a really impressive first impression.

**Define** one distinctive aesthetic item that is associated with you -- a
unique coat, a special necklace, a turquoise comb, etc.

### 16. How do you react to stressful situations?

The Realm expects its Dynasts to keep a firm handle on their emotions at all
times. Displays of passion are few and far between, and reserved for the most
sensitive or important of topics. Otherwise, you are expected to maintain a
steely mask of indifference.

What is your character's tick? No one maintains a perfect facade at all times.
Maybe when your character is stressed she starts to drum her fingers, or she
hums to herself or chews her lip.

**Consider** what noteworthy physical or verbal tick your character has that
hints that they are under stress. Consider how it relates to the flaws of your
Aspect -- for example, an Air Aspect under stress may loose their understanding
of other peoples' emotions or become consumed by the "big picture" as an escape
mechanism.

### 17. What biases have you inherited from your society?

You are the privileged scion of a mighty empire, so you've got some beliefs and
biases that you've inherited from your society. You don't need to agree with
these as a player; maybe this is a chance to play a character you disagree with.

Some common biases from Realm society can be:

> Men are too emotional to be trusted with power.
> Men are better aritsts than women.
> Women are always scheming and plotting their next move.
> Women naturally belong in control.
> The divine right of rule is established in the holy texts.
> Cowards must be exiled from society.

## Section VI: Appearance and Name

We are nearly finished now. What you look like and what you are called are
important aspects of any character, and we will elaborate on them in this
section.

### 18. What do you look like?

What do you look like? There are plenty of things to consider in answering this
question. What color is your skin? Your hair? Your eyes? Do you have any scars
or markings? Are you disabled in some visible way? How do you wear your hair?

The dominant ethnic group on the Blessed Isle is the Wàn. They strongly
resemble Han Chinese people.

Creation embraces an anime aesthetic when it comes to your hair and eyes; nearly
every color is natural somewhere. Embrace your weird looks!

In the section on [clothes](/gear/clothing/), you can read more about what
fashions are prominent on the Isle.

### 19. What is your character's personal name?

The dominant naming scheme is one or two-word names drawn from nature. Stuff
like River, Menhir, Sunlight, Rain, Red Crane, or Shining Jade. If you want a
word name but are having trouble, you can never go wrong with (Virtue) (Animal):
Dutiful Sparrow, Swift Hound, Brave Ox, etc.

The other name scheme is a phonetic name. These names rarely mean anything, and
are mostly chosen because they sound nice. You should go for an aesthetic
resembling Chinese, Japanese, or Indian names.

Were you named in honor of a family member? If so, your name is probably based
on theirs. Red Crane is named in honor of Silent Crane, or Banoba in honor of
Bandasi.

House names always come first, then the family name, then the given name. Most
Dynasts drop their family name in casual use. It is rude to address a person by
their personal name unless you are friends with them.

## Section VII: The End

Nothing lasts forever...

### 20. How will you die?

Everyone dies eventually!

Dragon-Blooded can live for centuries before they succumb to old age, but few
manage that. Most Dynasts die gloriously before making it to a century. Life as
a Prince of the Earth is always dangerous; the Realm says, "A Prince is always
three feet from death," referring to the normal length of a sword.

How will you die? Will you go gloriously on a battlefield? Of old age surronded
by wealth and family? Drowned at sea in a daring escapade?

## Final Touches

You have now created your character, congratulations! We have just a few last
finishing touches.

You have a pool of 18 Bonus Points to spend however you like according to the
following table. You may use these bonus points to raise your Abilities up to 5.
