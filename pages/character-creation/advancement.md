# Advancement

Instead of the default system of regular/dragon XP, we will use the following
session-based advancement, beginning with the first session of our adult arc:

- Every 2 sessions, choose:
  - A new Aspect/Favored Charm, or
  - A new Spell;
- Every 3 sessions, choose:
  - A new un-A/F Charm,
  - A Martial Arts Charm, favored or not,
  - A new Spell, favored or not,
  - A new Evocation,
  - A new Attribute dot, or
  - A dot of Willpower;
- At the end of the first session and every 2 sessions thereafter:
  - A new Ability dot,
  - A Merit dot,
  - A Specialty, or
  - _Waive_ this advancement twice in a row and get one of Anything that you
    want.

Essence increases from 2 to 3 after 15 sessions; from 3 to 4 after 50 total
sessions; and from 4 to 5 after 70 total sessions.

## Training Times

Training is not an instantaneous process. Assuming you devote most but not all
of your time to mastering your advancement, the times are as follows:

| Trait           | Time                         |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Attribute       | (new rating) months          |
| Non-A/F Ability | (new rating) weeks           |
| A/F Ability     | (new rating) days            |
| Specialty       | 2 weeks                      |
| Purchased Merit | (new rating) weeks           |
| Willpower       | one month                    |
| Charm (Non-A/F) | (Ability + Essence min) days |
| Charm (A/F)     | (Ability min) days           |
| Spell           | 2 weeks                      |
| Evocation       | (Essence min * 4) days       |
