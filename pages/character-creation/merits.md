# Merits

Merits are special advantages that your character possesses, such as allies,
relics, and soldiers. Most Merits don't offer a distinct mechanical advantage,
instead offering narrative potential. The benefit of a powerful ally is not that
you can add dice, but rather that you can call in favors, etc.

## Social Merits

Social merits define your position in society or your relationships with other
people.

### Allies [• or •••]

Each purchase of this Merit represents a powerful ally -- a close friend or
trusted companion with unique and useful capabilities. Your Ally is willing to
help you, but has their own agenda that may or may not align with yours.

**Define** your Ally by giving them a name and a nature. Tell us why they are
your ally. Give them two goals: one that aligns with yours, and one that might
sometimes oppose it.

> •: This Ally is a mortal, a minor spirit, or a young Dragon-Blood.

> •••: This Ally is one of the Chosen, at roughly your level.

the Thousand Scales or a senator's seat in the Deliberative.

responsibilities.

> little effective power.

> weight around but still answering to superiors.

> ••••: You have an elite position with plenty of power.

### Command [•• to •••••]

You are the recognized commander of a military unit. Your soldiers are
personally loyal to you -- when you draw your land in the sand, they will step
forward proudly. If your soldiers are more loyal to their organization, then
your command would probably be Backing.

**Define** your command by giving your unit a name -- the Iron Bull Talon, the
Crownkiller Dragon, etc. How did it get that name? What does your unit's
standard look like?

> ••: You have a small elite unit, or a medium-sized average unit.

> soldiers.

### Contacts [•, •••, or •••••]

You have a network of contacts you can call on to feed you info. They will not
deliberately betray you, but they are _contacts_, not friends or allies; they
may be wrong, or they may mislead your for their own ends.

**Define** your contacts by telling us their area of knowledge and where they
operate. Maybe throw in a name or a brief description of some major players.

> •: You have a network of contacts within one House, one organization, or
> confined to a single city.

> •••: You have a broad network of contacts throughout a whole House or region;
> wherever you go within that region, you know someone.

> •••••: No matter how far you travel or how obscure the thing you seek, as long

> coming out of your _ass_ there are so many.

### Followers [•, ••, or •••]

You have a number of mortal followers who all share an area of expertise or
focus. Examples would include traveling entertainers, courtesans, bureaucrats,

general group culture. Do any in particular stick out to you?

> •: You have up to a dozen followers.

> ••: You have up to 50 or so followers.

### Influence [• to •••••]

You have standing and pull in society. Most Dragon-Blooded have some degree of
this Merit coming from their House and social rank.

**Define** your Influence by telling us about where it comes from and how you
use it. Tell us about one group that aligns to it, and one that opposses it.

> •: You are a minor player on a local scale.

## Possession Merits

These Merits represent things that you own or have.

### Artifact [•• to •••••]

An Artifact is a magical relic with its own legend. Every Artifact ••• or higher
can unlock _Evocations_, powerful magic tied to the Artifact's history. The
ancestral staff of a famed Cynis politician spreads rumors and malice, or the
trident wielded by your once-Peleps father which he used to slay the behemoth
Dayôyu the All-Consuming.

Most Artifacts are weapons or armor, reflecting the martial heritage of the
Realm.

**Define** your Artifact by telling us what it is -- a sword, a spear, a magic
paintbrush, etc. Give us one or two sentences that broadly define its history.
I will work with you to figure out its actual magic.

> ••: A minor wonder: a magic brush that takes notes, an indestructible chest
> that only opens when exposed to its owners anima, a bird of living crystal
> that can spy.

> •••: The minimum rating for arms and armor. This Artifact is an extension of
> the wielder's skill; a javelin that flies long distances and bursts into
> flames.

> ••••: This Artifact has unique power that impacts your general playstyle. For
> example, fans that cause stormclouds or armor that offers limited flight.

> •••••: This Artifact redefines any scene that it appears in, with powerful
> magic that fundamentally changes the whole scene. A sword with a bound demon
> that unleashes hurricanes, or a hammer that summons whole volcanoes.

### Demesne [••]

You own a _demesne_, a Place of Power. A demesne arises when the elemental and
spiritual forces of the world imbue the world with Essence: a deep forest where
huge predators grow; a submerged garden of lantern-fish and coral palaces. The
deed -- and responsibility -- for this property are yours.

**Define** your demense by giving it a name: the Valley of Weeping Mehirs, the
Tigerwood Forest, etc. What element does it align to: Air, Earth, Fire, Water,
or Wood? What is the miraculous strangeness inside it?

specialty that it excels in: a hunting hawk, a scouting hound, a riding lion,
etc.

> ••: This Familiar is a formidable and useful beast -- a tiger, simhata,
> bear, claw strider, etc.

> a four-winged cock which breathes fire, a god-blooded horse sired by a nomad
> god, etc.

### Hearthstone [••]

You own a _hearthstone_, a jewel of concentrated elemental power which bestows
a special gift. If you slot this stone into a receptacle -- a necklace, a
crown, a socket on a sword -- you can unlock its power.

**Define** your Hearthstone by telling us about the manse or demesne that
produced it, and give us an element. How did you come to possess it?

### Manse [•••]

You own a _manse_, a magnificent magical fortress or palace built atop a Place
of Power to harness its energy.

**Define** your Manse by giving it a name and an element. Tell us about the
history of this building -- it is probably an inheritance from your family. What
purpose was it built for?

(This Merit grants you the benefit of both Demesne and Hearthstone for a slight
discount.)

## Physical and Mental Merits

These Merits represent aspects of your physical and mental excellence. Most of
these merits grant you 1 bonus die when they apply, and some permanent
passive.

You can define new physical or mental merits if you don't find one to your
liking. If it is very broadly applicable, it is worth ••; if it is narrowly
useful, it is •. If a Merit is mostly useful in combat, it is worth •••.

### Examples

**Boundless Endurance** [•]: You are a wellspring of vitality and no weariness
can touch you. You can go days without sleep and never fall asleep on watch.
Whenever this Merit is relevant, you gain 1 bonus die.

**Danger Sense** [••]: Your subconscious is always on the lookout for you. You
have a spider-sense that sometimes warns you of danger before it fully
manifests. Whenever this Merit is relevant, you gain 1 bonus die.

directions, even if you have no other reference points. You always know which
way you are facing, accurate to 8 points (N, NE, E, SE, S, ...). Whenever this
Merit is relevant, you gain 1 bonus die.

**Fast Reflexes** [•••]: You have lightning reflexes. You gain 1 bonus die on
Join Battle.

**Fleet of Foot** [•••]: You are swift and nimble. You glide through the world
like a breeze. You are quick enough to run down most mortals and animals, except
those renowned for their speed. Whenever this Merit is relevant (including in
rush, disengage, and withdraw actions), you gain 1 bonus die.

**Giant** [•••]: You are startlingly huge, measuring 6'6'' to 10' tall, and
proportionally broad. Whenever this Merit is relevant, including in using your
huge size to Intimidate or for greater reach in combat, you get 1 bonus die.

**Iron Stomach** [•]: You can digest almost anything edible, and some things
that... might not be? You can always find food for yourself, if there is any
food to be found. Whenever this Merit is relevant, you gain 1 bonus die.

**Natural Immunity** [••]: You are blessed with good health. You are resistant
to disease and heal quickly. Whenever this Merit is relevant, you gain 1 bonus
die.

organization's ledgers -- you gain 1 bonus die.

**Selective Conception** [•]: You have full control over your own fertility. You
will never be involved in the conception of a child except when you desire. If
you are the mother, you can spend 1wp to _guarantee_ conception. Although this
Merit may be silly, it can be surprisingly useful for a Dragon-Blooded scion,
who faces a huge cultural expectation with regards to children.

**Strong Lungs** [•]: You can hold your breath for much longer than a normal
human, generally about up to 10 minutes of easy action. Whenever this Merit is
relevant, you gain 1 bonus die.

Etc.
