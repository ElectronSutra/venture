# The Low Art of Nature

The world can be pretty tough.

## Survival

### Outdoorsmanship

In most circumstances, as long as you have brought appropriate supplies for the
trip, you will not need to roll to find food or make camp.

If you are stuck in the wilderness without supplies, or if you find yourself
journeying through especially difficult terrain, a single ([Intelligence or
Wits] + Survival) roll will cover a whole day's foraging, making camp, and other
basic survival precautions.

### Tracking

Tracking someone is a contested roll pitting your Survival against the target's.

### Handling Animals

Training an animal is probably an extended Survival roll with a difficulty based
on how stubborn the beastie is. Knowledge of the animal's behavior can help you
with bonuses or just through fun cool stunts.

### Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain gives you a -3 penalty to movement actions. It often has lots
of potential cover, which is a nice trade.

While moving across difficult terrain, you must use your reflexive movement two
turns in a row to move one range band, so you're boned.

## Environmental Hazards

An environmental hazard has a difficulty to avoid it, an interval in which it
deals damage, and a damage that it deals per interval.

### Avoiding an Environmental Hazard

When you are exposed to an environmental hazard, you can roll to avoid taking
damage from it. The exact nature of this roll depends on the hazard -- but
usually Stamina is good to endure something, and Dexterity good to get out of
the way.

### Interval

Every interval you are exposed to the hazard, you can make a roll to avoid it.
If you fail that roll, you suffer the hazard's damage.

### Damage

Environmental hazards usually ignore Soak and Hardness. If the hazard deals
bashing or lethal damage, it goes straight to your health track.

## Feats of Strength

A feat of strength lets you pull of heroic acts of physical prowess. Throwing
boulders and holding up a burning roof are good feats of strength. A feat of
destruction allows you to destroy something using your Raw Muscle Power.

### Minimum Strength Requirement

Feats of strength/demolition have a minimum Strength you must meet or exceed in
order to attempt them. You Must Be This Brawny To Pass.

### Automatic Success

You can automatically pull off a feat of strength if your pool is three times or
more the difficulty. At that point you're just so strong there's no good reason
to make you try.

### Example Charts

Here are some example feats of strength:

- STRENGTH 3: Lift a full-grown man over your head; throw an anvil through a
  wall; kick a door off its hinges; lift a horse; break stones on your knee;
  bend an iron bar with your bare hands and impressive moustache.
- STRENGTH 5: Throw a horse; bend a horseshoe into a balloon animal; snap iron
  manacles with your massive thighs; smash down a brick wall with a hammer; kick
  down an iron door and take the hinges with it.
- STRENGTH 7: Lift a boulder; raise a drawbridge with your muscles; grab the
  handholds of a fully-laden caravan wagon and drag it out of a chasm; grab a
  hold of iron bars and pry them out of their stone settings with a heave and a
  flex of your mighty pecs.
