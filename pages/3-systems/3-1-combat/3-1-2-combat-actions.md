# Combat Actions

On your turn, you get 1 _combat action_ and 1 _reflexive move_, which you may
perform in either order.

After you take your combat action, you may choose to _flurry_ and take a second
combat action.

## Reflexive Move

If you are **not obstructed by enemies, binds, or obstacles**, you may move one
range band toward any enemy or landmark or away from any enemy or landmark.

Moving within your range band costs nothing and can be done freely as part of
stunts and descriptions.

## List of Combat Actions

As long as you **do not attack**, you gain 5 Initiative at the end of your turn.

### Attack

> **Attack Action.** Do not gain 5 Initaitive at the end of your turn.

You may make a [**withering** or **decisive** attack](/venture/systems/combat/attacks)
against any enemy within range.

### Gambit

> **Attack Action.** Do not gain 5 Initiative at the end of your turn.

You may make a [gambit](/venture/systems/combat/gambits) to alter the
battlefield or gain an advantage.

### Rush

You barrel toward your target to follow them as they move.

Roll ([Dexterity or Strength] + Athletics) in an opposed roll against the
target. If you win, then whenever your target moves, you reflexively move one
range band with them, maintaining distance between the two of you. If your
opponent moves in a way you can't -- for example, flying vertically upwards if
you cannot fly -- then they get away.

At the start of your next turn, if your target **did not provoke your move**,
then you can make a free reflexive move; you can still spend your normal
reflexive move on top of this.

### Disengage

You move yourself out of the way of foes, ensuring that you are
**not obstructed by enemies**.

Roll ([Dexterity or Strength] + [Dodge or Athletics]) in an opposed roll against
every enemy you are engaged with. If you beat everyone, then you instantly move
to short range. Whenever they try to close on you, you may move one range band
away.

At the start of your next turn, if your target **did not provoke your move**,
then you can make a free reflexive move; you can still spend your normal
reflexive move on top of this.

### Aim

> **Flurry Restriction.** This action cannot be flurried with any other action.

You lock on to a target.

If you are at medium range or greater from your target, _aim_ allows you to
attack them.

If you are able to attack your target when you _aim_, gain +3 dice on your next
attack against your target.

If you move or take an action other than aiming, your aim is lost.

### Defend Other

Choose a target who is close to you. They become your _ward_. Whenever anyone
would attack your ward, they have to get through you first.

You may apply your Parry in place of the target's Defense. If the opponent
overcomes your Parry, they attack you instead. If the opponent has enough
successes to overcome your Parry _and_ your ward's Defense, they may choose to
attack your ward instead.

### Draw/Ready Weapon

You draw or ready a weapon to use in the fight.

You never need to draw or ready your **natural weapons**: fists, knees, etc.

### Full Defense

> **Flurry Restriction.** This action can only be flurried with a
> [Social Influence](#social-influence) action.

You gain +2 Defense until your next turn.

### Social Influence

Your speak up or speak out. You may use any
[social influence](/venture/systems/social-influence/) action on your turn.

### Miscellaneous Action

Anything else is a Miscellaneous Action. You take -1 Defense, because you are
distracted with the other thing you are doing.

## Flurries

After you take your combat action, you may choose to _flurry_. A flurry costs
3 Initiative per action, for a base total of 6 Initiative -- this can be
mitigated to 1 Initiative if neither action is an attack, or increased to 11 if
you Crash yourself.

You may not flurry two of the same action. Some actions are noted as having a
**flurry restriction**, which applies some additional restriction.
