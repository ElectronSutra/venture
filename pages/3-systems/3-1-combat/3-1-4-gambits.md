# Gambits

_Gambits_ are a core part of Hissatsu. A _gambit_ is any action which results in
a major, tangible change to the course of battle. These gambits allow you to do
things like introduce hazards, disarm opponents, set things on fire, etc.

## Examples of Gambits

- Topple a pho cart to obstruct your pursuers;
- Disarm your opponent with your scarf;
- Throw knives to pin your opponent's clothes to the ground;
- Collapse the bridge you are fighting on with a Feat of Strength;
- Throw a bomb from your belt;
- Rip open the behemoth's glowing weak spot to allow an attack;
- Unfurl the ship's sails right into your opponent's face, blinding him and
  leaving him dazed;
- Smash a jar of oil and set it ablaze with an anima trick;
- Wrap your opponent with magical prayer strips;
- Disable your target's left arm with pinpoint qi strikes;
- Grab your opponent with your bare hands and wrestle him to the ground;
- Distract your opponent, opening an opportunity for your ally;
- Unhorse your opponent, sending him crashing to the ground;
- etc.

## Establishing a Gambit

Describe what you would like to accomplish. If it meets one of the existing
gambits documented below, use that; otherwise, I will come up with a difficulty
and effect for you. You can always choose to take another action if you don't
like the cost.

Some gambits succeed automatically, especially if there is no opposition --
toppling a pho cart just happens. Most gambits require a roll. If it directly
opposes a foe -- like disarming them -- then you make an opposed roll against
the target. Otherwise, make a roll against the described difficulty.

Whether you suceed or not, you spend (gambit rank) Initiative to establish the
gambit. Reduce this cost by 1 if you fail.

## Predefined Gambits

These gambits are common enough that they are defined in advance.

### Create an Environmental Hazard

> **Rank**: 5i, 10i, 15i, or 20i

If you succeed, you create an environmental hazard that can deal damage over
time to anyone caught inside it. The environmental hazard engulfs a whole range
band, either the one you are in or one at short range from you, depending on the
description of the hazard.

Hazards can deal single instances of damage, or damage over time. The damage of
the hazard depends on the rank.

Whenever a character is exposed to a hazard, they may make a roll to avoid the
damage; Dexterity, Dodge, Athletics, etc. can allow you to avoid a hazard
entirely, and Stamina, Resistance, Integrity, etc. will allow you to push
through it. If you succeed at the roll, you completely avoid all damage; if you
fail, then you reduce the damage (or damage for this interval) by 1 for every
success you did gain, minimum 1.

#### Hazards Table

| Rank | Hazard Diff | Single Damage | Repeating Damage | Examples                   |
| :--- | :---------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| 5i   | Diff. 3     | 3 HLs         | 2 dice/round     | Falling tree; mudflow      |
| 10i  | Diff 5      | 5 HLs         | 4 dice/round     | Collapsing roof; bonfire   |
| 15i  | Diff 5      | 7 HLs         | 5 dice/round     | Avalanche, temple collapse |
| 20i  | Diff 5      | 10 HLs        | 6 dice/round     | Lava flow; collapsing mine |

### Disarm

> **Rank**: 3i

You knock your opponent's weapon out of their hands. They must spend a
draw/ready weapon action to get it back.

### Assemble Cover

> **Rank**: 2i, 4i, or 6i

You grab various bits of the environment or use your power to raise up walls
and barricades. Every 2i you spend gives you one additional step of cover; so
2i gives you light cover, 4i gives you heavy cover, and 6i gives you full cover.
If you already have cover, reinforcing it only costs the difference -- light
cover to full cover costs 4i.

You immediately take cover behind what you have assembled.

You may also _Destroy Cover_. The cost is the same, but instead of building it,
you tear it down.

### Disable

> **Rank**: 5i

You disable a target's capabilities. You might blind them, lock one of their
arms from use, etc. You inflict them with an appropriate
[status](/venture/systems/combat/status) based on your description.

They must spend a Miscellaneous action to restore their function, or use an
effect that allows them to do so.

### Distract

> **Rank**: 2i - 10i

You distract the target, opening an opportunity for your ally to attack.

Your ally gains the Initiative you spend, minus 1. They _must_ use it next turn
to make an attack against the target of the Distract gambit, or they lose it.

A character may only benefit from one distract gambit at a time.

### Exert Pressure

> **Rank**: 2i - 10i

You stretch yourself thin, cutting through your opponent's defenses.

The defender loses half of the rank, rounded down. They can't do anything to
stop the damage if you succeed at the gambit. This damage ignores their Soak and
leeches from them straight away.

### Knock Prone

> **Rank**: 1i

You knock your target prone.

### Unhorse

> **Rank**: 4i

You knock your opponent off of their mount.

He loses the [_mounted_ status](/venture/systems/combat/status#mounted) from his
mount and is knocked prone.

### Grapple

> **Rank** 2i

Make an attack roll against your target, per usual. If you win, you attempt to
grapple them.

Roll (Strength + Brawl/Martial Arts) opposed by the target; if you are using a
weapon with the [_Grappling_ tag](/venture/gear/weaponry#grappling), you may
use the weapon's Ability instead. If one of you is so physically large that the
other cannot resist, you roll unopposed.

If you win the roll, you _establish control_ of the grapple and have them in
your grip. They gain the [_Clinched_](/venture/systems/combat/status#clinched)
status. If they tie you or win, they escape at the start of their next turn.

While you are in a grapple, you may only _savage_, _throw/slam_,
_restrain/drag_, or _release_.

#### Rounds of Control

You get 1 round of control for each success on your control roll in excess of
your target's.

You lose 1 round of control whenever you are targeted by an attack, even if the
attack misses.

#### Savage

Spend 1 round of control. Make an automatically successful attack against your
clinched defender. They get difficulty 0, if it matters for any rules.

#### Throw/Slam

You spend all remaining rounds of control. You _savage_ your target, and up to
(your Strength) of the rounds you spend eac add 1 **decisive** damage, or 2
withering damage. Your opponent is then released.

#### Restrain/Drag

Spend 2 rounds of control. Your opponent cannot take any actions on their next
turn. You may use your reflexive move to drag your opponent with you until the
start of your next turn.

#### Release

You let your opponent go.
