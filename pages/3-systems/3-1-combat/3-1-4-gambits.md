# Gambits

**Gambits** are a way to enact permanent change to the battlefield other than
dealing damage to your opponent. Mechanically, a **gambit** is a special type
of **decisive** attack, so any magic, effects, or rules that apply to
**decisive** attacks also apply to gambits.

Gambits include things like introducing hazards, disarming opponents, setting
things on fire, collapsing walls, and so on.

## Examples of **Gambits**

- Topple a pho cart to obstruct your pursuers;
- Disarm your opponent;
- Throw knives to pin your opponent's clothes and hold him in place;
- Collapse a bridge you are fighting on;
- Throw a bomb from your belt;
- Rip open the giant's glowing weakpoint for massive damage;
- Unfurl the ship's sails into the opponent's face to blind him;
- Smash a jar of oil and set it ablaze;
- Wrap your opponent in magical prayer strips;
- Disable your opponent's left arm with a series of snake-hand strikes;
- Grab your opponent and wrestle him to the ground;
- Distract your opponent to open an opportunity for your ally;
- Unhorse your opponent and send him crashing to the ground;
- etc.

## Establishing a **Gambit**

Describe what you would like to accomplish.

If it has no opposition -- for example, toppling a cart -- then it is
automatically established. If it is opposed by something, you will _roll to_
_establish_ the **gambit**.

If you successfully establish your **gambit**, spend (gambit rank)i. If you
failed to establish it, pay 1i less.

## Common **Gambits**

These **gambits** are common enough that they are conveniently defined in
advance.

### Create an Environmental Hazard

> **Rank**: 5i, 10i, 15i, or 20i

If you succeed, you create an environmental hazard that can deal damage over
time to anyone caught inside it. The environmental hazard engulfs a whole range
band, either the one you are in or one at short range from you, depending on the
description of the hazard.

Hazards can deal single instances of damage, or damage over time. The damage of
the hazard depends on the rank.

Whenever a character is exposed to a hazard, they may make a roll to avoid the
damage; Dexterity, Dodge, Athletics, etc. can allow you to avoid a hazard
entirely, and Stamina, Resistance, Integrity, etc. will allow you to push
through it. If you succeed at the roll, you completely avoid all damage; if you
fail, then you reduce the damage (or damage for this interval) by 1 for every
success you did gain, minimum 1.

#### Hazards Table

| Rank | Hazard Diff | Single Damage | Repeating Damage | Examples                   |
| :--- | :---------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| 5i   | Diff. 3     | 3 HLs         | 2 dice/round     | Falling tree; mudflow      |
| 10i  | Diff 5      | 5 HLs         | 4 dice/round     | Collapsing roof; bonfire   |
| 15i  | Diff 5      | 7 HLs         | 5 dice/round     | Avalanche, temple collapse |
| 20i  | Diff 5      | 10 HLs        | 6 dice/round     | Lava flow; collapsing mine |

### Disarm

> **Rank**: 3i

You knock your opponent's weapon out of their hands. They must spend a
draw/ready weapon action to get it back.

### Disable

> **Rank**: 5i

You disable a target's capabilities. You might blind them, lock one of their
arms from use, etc. You inflict them with an appropriate
[status](/venture/systems/combat/status) based on your description.

They must spend a Miscellaneous action to restore their function, or use an
effect that allows them to do so.

### Distract

> **Rank**: 2i - 10i

You distract the target, opening an opportunity for your ally to attack.

Your ally gains the Initiative you spend, minus 1. They _must_ use it next turn
to make an attack against the target of the Distract gambit, or they lose it.

A character may only benefit from one distract gambit at a time.

### Exert Pressure

> **Rank**: 2i - 10i

You cut through your opponent's defenses.

The difficulty to establish this gambit is your opponent's Defense. If you
succeed, they lose half of the cost of this **gambit** in Initiative, rounded
down.

This gambit exists to allow you to spend your own resources to ignore the
target's Soak, potentially opening them to an ally's attack.

### Knock Prone

> **Rank**: 1i

Knock your target prone.

### Unhorse

> **Rank**: 4i

You knock your opponent off of their mount.

He loses the [_mounted_ status](/venture/systems/combat/status#mounted) from his
mount and is knocked prone.

### Grapple

> **Rank** 2i

Make an attack roll against your target, per usual. If you win, you attempt to
grapple them.

Roll (Strength + Brawl/Martial Arts) opposed by the target; if you are using a
weapon with the [_Grappling_ tag](/venture/gear/weaponry#grappling), you may
use the weapon's Ability instead. If one of you is so physically large that the
other cannot resist, you roll unopposed.

If you win the roll, you _establish control_ of the grapple and have them in
your grip. They gain the [_Clinched_](/venture/systems/combat/status#clinched)
status. If they tie you or win, they escape at the start of their next turn.

While you are in a grapple, you may only _savage_, _throw/slam_,
_restrain/drag_, or _release_.

#### Rounds of Control

You get 1 round of control for each success on your control roll in excess of
your target's.

You lose 1 round of control whenever you are targeted by an attack, even if the
attack misses.

#### Savage

Spend 1 round of control. Make an automatically successful attack against your
clinched defender. They get difficulty 0, if it matters for any rules.

#### Throw/Slam

You spend all remaining rounds of control. You _savage_ your target, and up to
(your Strength) of the rounds you spend eac add 1 **decisive** damage, or 2
withering damage. Your opponent is then released.

#### Restrain/Drag

Spend 2 rounds of control. Your opponent cannot take any actions on their next
turn. You may use your reflexive move to drag your opponent with you until the
start of your next turn.

#### Release

You let your opponent go.
