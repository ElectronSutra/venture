# Turn Order and Initiative

Combat begins whenever one character chooses to enact violence onto another and
all participants are **worthy foes**. If your opponent is not a **worthy foe**,
you don't engage the combat action; you can just roll to see who wins.

The first thing that happens is that everyone involved in combat rolls
[Join Battle](#join-battle) to determine the starting Initiative. Then, you take
turns until the combat is over.

## Initiative

_Initiative_ is your narrative control in the fight. The higher Initiative you
have, the more your character controls the fight. The less Initiative you have,
the more your character is dominated by the opponent.

During the fight, your Initiative will go up and down as you take and make
attacks.

In costs, _i_ is the symbol for Initiative. So a cost of "2i" means "spend 2
Initiative."

### Gaining Initiative

You gain Initiative by making **withering** attacks against opponents.

### Losing Initiative

You lose Initiative by being attacked; by cashing in your Initiative to make a
killing blow; by spending it on effects; and by getting Crashed.

### Base Initiative

Your base Initiative is 2 + (Stamina/2, round up). This value is important
because it is the value you reset to after making a
[**decisive** attack](/venture/systems/combat/attacks#decisive-attack).

## Join Battle

**Join Battle** is the roll you make to enter combat and generate your starting
Initiative. You begin the fight with 3 Initiative, plus 1 Initiative for each
success you roll.

If you **Join Battle and throw yourself into the fray**, you roll (Wits +
Awareness).

If you **Join Battle from stealth or seclusion**, you may use Stealth instead of
Awareness.

If you **Join Battle to escalate a conversation to violence**, you may use
Manipulation instead of Wits.

### Free Action

When you roll Join Battle, you may perform a single unopposed non-damaging
combat action. For many people, this is to _Draw/Ready_ your chosen weapon.
You may enter a Form, take cover, activate a Charm, etc.

Your free action happens in turn order from highest to lowest.

## From the Top

Turn Order begins with the highest Initiative, and proceeds down to the lowest.

Combat is composed of a series of _ticks_. A tick is a specific number on which
someone can act. If you have 5 Initiative, you act on tick 5.

On your turn, you may take 1 _combat action_ and 1 _reflexive move_.

### Delaying Your Action

When your tick comes up, you may spend 1i to delay your action until a later
tick. You then hold your turn until you declare that you want to use it.

### Flurrying

After you've taken your action for the round, you may decide to take a second
action by taking a _flurry_. The second action gets a -3 flurry penalty. The
first action _next_ round also gets a -3 flurry penalty. This enables you to
make an informed decision as to how you want to act, based on this turn.

## Your Turn, In Detail

From a technical perspective, a couple things happen on your turn.

### Delying Your Action

### Formal Start-of-Turn

When you start your turn, the following happen in order:

1. Effects that last for one turn such as Onslaught, poisons with a duration of
   "1 turn," environmental hazards, etc. resolve.
2. If you are Crashed and have 3 or more recovery tokens, remove all your
   recovery tokens and you are no longer Crashed.
3. If you Rushed or Disengaged last turn and did not get to move, you may move
   now.
4. Anima flux and ot her "at the beginning of turn" effects resolve.

### Middle of Your Turn

You get up to 1 _combat action_ and up to 1 _reflexive move_.

### Formal End-of-Turn

After you spend your combat action and reflexive move or decide to pass, the
following happen in order:

1. If you are Crashed, you gain a recovery token. If you did not attack, gain
   one additional recovery token.
2. Anything which says "until the end of your next turn" resolves.
3. Regain 5m from adrenaline.
