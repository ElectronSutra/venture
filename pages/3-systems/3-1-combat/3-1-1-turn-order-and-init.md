# Turn Order and Initiative

Combat begins whenever one character chooses to enact violence onto another and
all participants are **worthy foes**. If your opponent is not a **worthy foe**,
you don't engage the combat action; you can just roll to see who wins.

The first thing that happens is that everyone involved in combat rolls
[Join Battle](#join-battle) to determine the starting Initiative. Then, you take
turns until the combat is over.

## Join Battle

**Join Battle** is the roll you make to enter combat and generate your starting
Initiative. You begin the fight with 3 Initiative, plus 1 Initiative for each
success you roll.

If you **Join Battle and throw yourself into the fray**, you roll (Wits +
Awareness).

If you **Join Battle from stealth or seclusion**, you may use Stealth instead of
Awareness.

If you **Join Battle to escalate a conversation to violence**, you may use
Manipulation instead of Wits.

### Free Action

When you roll Join Battle, you may perform a single unopposed non-damaging
combat action. For many people, this is to _Draw/Ready_ your chosen weapon.
You may enter a Form, take cover, activate a Charm, etc.

Your free action happens in turn order from highest to lowest.

## From the Top

Turn Order begins with the highest Initiative, and proceeds down to the lowest.

On your turn, you may take 1 _combat action_ and 1 _reflexive move_.

### Delaying Your Action

When your tick comes up, you may spend 1i to delay your action until a later
tick. You then hold your turn until you declare that you want to use it.

### Flurrying

After you've taken your action for the round, you may decide to take a second
action by taking a _flurry_. The second action gets a -3 flurry penalty. The
first action next round also gets a -3 flurry penalty.

## Initiative

_Initiative_ is your narrative control in the fight. The higher Initiative you
have, the more your character controls the fight. The less Initiative you have,
the more your character is dominated by the opponent.

During the fight, your Initiative will go up and down as you take and make
attacks.

In costs, _i_ is the symbol for Initiative. So a cost of "2i" means "spend 2
Initiative."

### Gaining Initiative

You gain Initiative by making **withering** attacks against opponents.

### Losing Initiative

You lose Initiative by being attacked; by cashing in your Initiative to make a
killing blow; by spending it on effects; and by getting Crashed.

### Base Initiative

Your base Initiative is 2 + (Stamina/2, round up). This value is important
because it is the value you reset to after making a
[**decisive** attack](/venture/systems/combat/attacks#decisive-attack).
