# Attacks

Whenever you attack, make a choice:

- **Withering**: I am targeting my opponent's narrative control to change the
  flow of the fight.
- **Decisive**: I am spending my narrative control to permanently harm my
  target.

From the perspective of your character, this distinction does not exist -- it is
a purely mechanical distinction. During the fight, you are storyboarding the
battle, so the **withering**/**decisive** distinction lets you choose which kind
of panel you are adding to the storyboard.

## Withering Attack

A **withering** attack is a projection of killing intent. Controlling space with
footwork, feinting to get in a strike, or forcing the enemy onto the defensive
are all **withering** attacks.

### Resolving a Withering Attack

Roll (Dexterity + [attack skill] + Accuracy) against the target's Defense. If
you are using a heavy weapon, you may use Strength instead of Dexterity. If you
meet or exceed your target's Defense, you hit them.

### Withering Damage

Your raw damage is (Strength + weapon damage), unless your weapon has a tag that
uses another calculation.

Subtract your target's Soak to determine your _effective damage_. Damage cannot
be reduced below your weapon's **Overwhelming** value.

Your target loses 1 Initiative for every point of effective damage they take.

### Withering Attack Cleanup

Your target gets 1 point of Onslaught, whether you hit them or not.

If your attack reduces your target to 0 Initiative or less, you have
[_Crashed_](/venture/systems/combat/status#crash) them. You gain +5 Initiative
for seizing control of the fight.

## Decisive Attack

A **decisive** attack is a terrific killing blow with deadly consequences. It
might be stabbing someone through the gut, a desperate all-or-nothing attack to
ram your spear through his neck, or any other such attack.

A **decisive** attack cashes in your narrative power to deal damage. As a
result, making a **decisive** attack leaves you temporarily vulnerable -- you
have put yourself in danger in order to get what you want.

### Resolving a Decisive Attack

Declare your _commitment_. This is how much Initiative you are willing to spend
for damage. Your commitment can range from 1 to 20. You **may** spend more
Initiative than you have; this will Crash you, but allow you to do significantly
more damage.

Roll (Dexterity + [attack skill] + Accuracy) against the target's Defense. If
you are using a heavy weapon, you may use Strength instead of Dexterity. If you
meet or exceed your target's Defense, you hit them.

You immediately lose the Initiative you have committed. If this puts you at 0 or
less, you are Crashed.

### Decisive Damage

Your base damage is equal to your commitment. Commiting 10 Initiative makes a
base of 10 damage.

Reduce this damage by your target's Initiative. This means that your attack is
based on the relative power between you and your opponent. If they are Crashed,
their Initiative _adds_ to your damage.

If the effective damage is equal to or greater than the target's Hardness, roll
your damage as a dice pool; **this is the only roll in _Exalted_ which does**\
**not double 10s**. Each success inflicts 1 point of damage on your target's
health track.

### Lethality

Every fight has a _lethality_, which determines how much damage you can do in
a single **decisive** blow. Your effective **decisive** damage cannot exceed
the fight's lethality.

_The default lethality is 15_. Lethality 5 and 8 may occur in fights with a
higher desired exchange of blows, such as a boxing match. Lethality
_**Hisatsu**_ means no cap -- one-hit deathblows are enabled. Be careful.

### Decisive Attack Cleanup

Your target gains 1 point of Onslaught, whether you hit them or not.

If the target is at 3 or less Initiative after the attack, he resets to 3
Initiative immediately.
