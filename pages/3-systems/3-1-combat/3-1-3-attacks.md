# Attacks

When you attack, choose:

- **withering**: I am targeting my opponent's narrative control to change the
  flow of this fight; or,
- **Decisive**: I am spending my narrative control to permanently harm my
  opponent.

## Diegesis

Diegetically, there is no distinction between **withering** and **decisive**
attacks. For your character, every attack is an attack is an attack -- they are
all intended to harm.

The **withering**/**decisive** distinction is purely narrative. Imagine that the
fight is a storyboard; the distinction asks you to choose, are you adding a
normal fight panel, or one with a climactic blow?

## **Withering** Attack

A **withering** attack is a projection of killing intent. Controlling space with
footwork, feinting to get a strike, or forcing the opponent onto the defensive
are all **withering** attacks. Most cinematic fights are composed mostly of
**withering** attacks.

### Resolving a **Withering** Attack

1. Roll (Dexterity + [combat Ability] + Accuracy) against the target's Defense.
   The target then gains 1 Onslaught. If you succeed, proceed to step 2; if you
   fail, end.
2. You gain 1i for making a successful **withering** attack. Proceed to step 3.
3. Apply your effective damage to the target's Initiative pool. Proceed to step
   4.
4. You gain the Initiative your target lost. If you reduced them to 0 or less,
   you gain an additional +5 Initiative "Crash bonus." End.

### **Withering** Damage

**Withering** attacks deal damage to the victim's Initiative.

Your _raw damage_ is (Strength + weapon damage). Then, subtract your target's
Soak to get your _effective damage_. Your _effective damage_ cannot be
reduced to less than your attack's Overwhelming (OVW) value.

The target loses 1i for each point of effective damage they take. You gain 1i
for every 1i they lose, plus 1i for making a successful attack.

### **withering** Attack Example

Red Crane attacks Handsome Li. Handsome Li's Defense is 4, and Red Crane rolls
6 successes. She hits.

Her raw damage is 7 (OVW 1). Handsome Li's Soak is 2, so she deals 5 effective
damage to him. Handsome Li loses 5i and Red Crane gains 6i.

## **Decisive** Attack

A **decisive** attack is a terrific finishing blow with deadly consequences. It
might be stabbing someone through the gut, a desperate all-or-nothing rain of
blows, or any other such attack that inflicts permanent harm on your target.

In a movie, the **decisive** attacks are the ones that hit with major impact,
the kind of blows where the camera slows down or the screen goes all wonky.

A **decisive** attack cashes in your narrative control (Initiative) to inflict
permanent harm. Having done so, the flow now shifts to your opponent to respond
-- if they survived.

### Resolving a **Decisive** Attack

1. Roll (Dexterity + [combat Ability]) against the target's Defense. Note that
   unlike a **withering** attack, you don't apply your Accuracy here. The target
   gains 1 Onslaught. If you fail, proceed to step 2; if you succeed, proceed to
   step 3.
2. If you fail to hit your target, you lose Initiative based on how much you
   currently have. If you have 11+ Initiative, you lose 3i for failing a
   **decisive** attack. Otherwise, you lose 2i. End.
3. Your raw damage is equal to your current Initiative. If your raw damage is
   greater than your target's Hardness, proceed to step 4. If your raw damage
   is equal to or less than your target's Hardness, proceed directly to step 5.
4. Roll your base damage and do NOT double 10s. Every success inflicts one level
   of damage on the opponent's health track. Proceed to step 5.
5. You reset to [base Initiative](/venture/systems/combat/turn-order-and-initiative#base-initiative).
   End.

### **Decisive** Damage

**Decisive** attacks deal damage to the target's health track.

Your attack deals _bashing_ or _lethal_ damage depending on whether the weapon
has the Bashing or Lethal tag. Bashing damage heals quicker and, if you knock
out an opponent with bashing damage, they are unconscious. Lethal damage heals
more slowly and, if you knock out an opponent with lethal damage, you may choose
to either force them into unconsciousness or put them into a dying state.

**Hardness** is an armor trait which protects against damage. You must exceed
a target's Hardness in order to deal damage to them. If your raw damage on a
**decisive** attack is equal to or less than the target's Hardness, they just
absorb your attack.

## Defense

Your **Defense** is the number you use to defend against incoming attacks. Your
Defense is the _higher_ of your Evasion and your Parry.

If an attack is **unblockable**, your Defense is your Evasion, since you cannot
parry.

If an attack is **undodgeable**, your Defense is your Parry, since you cannot
evade.

### Onslaught

**Onslaught** is a penalty from being attacked. Every attack you take, whether
you are hit or it misses, increases your Onslaught by 1. This represents how
you gradually stagger and open up by taking attacks or defending against them
-- think about it as the equivalent of enemies staggering a little bit when you
hit them in a video game.

Each point of Onslaught applies a -1 Defense penalty. Onslaught is also a
resource that can be used by some Charms to pull of big finishers.

Onslaught persists until the start of your next turn. Then, it goes back to 0.
