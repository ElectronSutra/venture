# Attacks

When you attack, choose:

- **withering**: I am targeting my opponent's narrative control to change the
  flow of this fight; or,
- **Decisive**: I am spending my narrative control to permanently harm my
  opponent.

## Diegesis

Diegetically, there is no distinction between **withering** and **decisive**
attacks. For your character, every attack is an attack is an attack -- they are
all intended to harm.

The **withering**/**decisive** distinction is purely narrative. Imagine that the
fight is a storyboard; the distinction asks you to choose, are you adding a
normal fight panel, or one with a climactic blow?

## **Withering** Attacks

A **withering** attack is a projection of killing intent. Controlling space with
footwork, feinting to get a strike, or forcing the opponent onto the defensive
are all **withering** attacks. Most cinematic fights are composed mostly of
**withering** attacks.

### Resolving a **Withering** Attack

1. Roll ([Strength or Dexterity] + [combat Ability] + Accuracy) against the
   target's Defense. Your target gains 1 Onslaught. If you succeeded, proceed
   to step 2. If you failed, end.
2. The attack's _raw damage_ is equal to (Strength + weapon Damage). Proceed to
   step 3.
3. Subtract the target's Soak from the raw damage to get the _effective damage_.
   An attack's effective damage cannot be reduced to less than the weapon's
   Overwhelming. Roll the _effective damage_ as a pool and proceed to step 4.
4. Gain 1i for landing a successful attack. Then, for each success you rolled on
   the effective damage roll, your opponent loses 1i and you gain 1i. End.

### Crash

If your attack reduces a target to 0 or less Initiative, you have "Crashed"
them. Your target gains the [Crashed](/systems/combat/status#crashed) status.

If you force an opponent into Crash, you gain a _Break bonus_ of +5i, on top of
the regular Initiative you gain.

### Shift

If you can Crash the person who forced you into Crash, you not only gain the
regular Break bonus for forcing someone into Crash. You become
[Shifted](/systems/combat/status#shifted), which lets you roll Join Battle again
to gain _even more_ Initiative. A powerful bonus!

## **Decisive** Attacks

A **decisive** attack is a terrific finishing blow with deadly consequences. It
might be stabbing someone through the gut, a desperate all-or-nothing rain of
blows, or any other such attack that inflicts permanent harm on your target.

In a movie, the **decisive** attacks are the ones that hit with major impact,
the kind of blows where the camera slows down or the screen goes all wonky.

A **decisive** attack cashes in your narrative control (Initiative) to inflict
permanent harm. Having done so, the flow now shifts to your opponent to respond
-- if they survived.

### Resolving a **Decisive** Attack

1. Roll (Dexterity + [combat Ability]) against the target's Defense -- note that
   you are _not_ adding Accuracy (but don't worry, Lot-Casting Atemi does this
   for you automatically). Your target gains 1 Onslaught. If you failed, proceed
   to step 2. If you succeeded, proceed to step 3.
2. If you fail your attack roll, you lose a bit of Initiative. If you have 11+
   Initiative, you lose 3. Otherwise, you lose 2. End.
3. If you succeed on your attack roll, your _raw damage_ is a pool of dice equal
   to your current Initiative. Check your target's Hardness. If your raw damage
   is greater than your target's Harndess, proceed to step 4. If your raw damage
   is equal to or less than your target's Hardness, proceed immediately to step
   5.
4. Roll your raw damage as a dice pool. DO NOT DOUBLE 10s -- this is the only
   roll in _Exalted_ that, by default, does not double 10s. Each success you
   roll inflicts 1 level of damage to the opponent's health track.
5. Reset to [base Initiative](/systems/combat/turn-order-and-initiative#base-initiative).
   End.

## Defense

Every character has two methods to avoid harm: she can get out of the way, or
she can try to block the attack.

Your **Evasion** represents your ability to get out of the way.

Your **Parry** depends on your current weapon, and represents your ability to
block an incoming attack.

Your **Defense** is the higher of your Evasion and your Parry. This is the
difficulty to hit you. You are always assumed to use your _best_ available
defense against all incoming attacks.

### Onslaught

**Onslaught** is a penalty you get from being attacked, regardless of whether
the attack hits or misses. In the narrative, this is meant to represent
"stagger" or "beatdown" -- it is supposed to represent the fatigue of defending
against several incoming attacks without being able to catch your breath.

Each point of Onslaught reduces your Defense by 1. Onslaught is also used as a
resource for some Charms and techniques.

Your Onslaught resets at _the start of your turn_. Note that this means that if
your opponent is able to act _after_ you one round and _before_ you the next,
they can capitalize on your Onslaught before it has a chance to reset -- a
mean trick.
