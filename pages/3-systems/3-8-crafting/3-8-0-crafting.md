# The Silver Art of Craft

The craft system in _Exalted_ assumes that you are frequently making things.

That might seem odd to point out, but it's a crucial assumption here. In a lot
of games, you can invest into the craft skill and _never use it_ except for once
at the end of the story when you disappear for a couple weeks and make THE BEST
SWORD EVER.

_Exalted_ does not work like that.

If you want to craft, you've got to **craft**. Look for problems that can be
solved my making things, and make them. Make lots of little things, and lots of
big things. You'll be good at crafting if you actively, frequently choose to
build.

## The Basics of Craft

The Craft Ability behaves a little weird. Unlike other Abilities, Craft is
scoped to a specific profession. So you can have Craft: Armorer 4 but Craft:
Tailor 1, for example.

The core of the Silver Art is _crafting projects_. Any time you are making
something with Craft, you are doing a project. Doing project gets you _Craft_
_XP_, which you spend to complete bigger projects.

You get the ball rolling, and then keep it rolling.

## When Do You Not Use Craft?

Lots of skills can be used to make things. Medicine can be used to make a
poultice or herbal tea, Survival can be used to make lean-tos and bear traps,
and Linguistics can be used to make poetry, illuminated manuscripts, and
woodblock prints.

However, most of the time, _those things don't need rolls_. It is rarely fun or
dramatic to know if you are able to, say, brew an herbal tea as part of a
treatment -- you're a doctor, you know how to do that. You can probably do it
_without rolling_.

When things get complicated enough that they involve rolling, _then_ you're
probably going to engage the Craft system.
