# The August Art of Getting Shit Done

**Bureaucracy**. A skill that might, at first glance, seem useless -- how often
in, say, D&D are you going to be rolling to fill out paperwork?

In _Exalted_, Bureaucracy can be an incredibly powerful skill, because you are
an incredibly powerful person. _Especially_ in the Realm, where formal systems
allow the wise to exploit the systems for personal gain, a skilled bureaucrat
can be an invaluable ally -- or a devastating foe.

## The Power of Systems

_Exalted_ attempts to present a world based on history, and the fact of history
is that those who had power structured a system to benefit those who know how to
use it. Kings, ministers, and other officials wielded incredible power, and in
_Exalted_ your fledgling kingdom can be made or broken by the people you invite
to be part of it.

This is all a long-winded way of saying that if you choose to be good at
Bureaucracy, and you make sure to actually _use_ it, you can enact some major
wide-reaching and subtle change. Adjusting tax rates and negotiating
import/export duties doesn't sound thrilling, but a well-placed bribe in the
form of a marginal tax break can sway some people more than even a knife to
their throat.

## Administration

_Administration_ is your ability to work within an existing system.  You use
this aspect of Bureaucracy to interact with ministers and be part of a bigger
system.

## Orchestration

_Orchestration_ is your ability to orchestrate projects and organize lots of
people to work to a shared goal. You use this aspect of Bureaucracy to run a
business, manage employees, and plan and execute projects.
