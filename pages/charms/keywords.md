# Keywords

A keyword is a bit of Charm shorthand to avoid having to write the same
sentences over and over again.

## Elemental Keywords

All Dragon-Blooded Charms are aligned to one or more of the five elements. A
Charm's elemental affinity is represented by the _Air_, _Earth_, _Fire_,
_Water_, or _Wood_ keyword.

If a Charm lists two elements separated by a slash (for example, "Air/Water"),
that means that the Charm gets _both_ elements, and you can choose whichever one
is better for you at that moment.

### Aura

This Charm can only be used if you are in this Charm's element's Aura. It cannot
be used in the same instant as Charms of a different element.

### Balanced

This Charm doesn't count for or against your Aura.

### Variable

When you use this Charm, pick one of the listed elements. This Charm is of that
element and has a different effect depending on which element you pick.

## Other Keywords

These other keywords encode simple rule snippets to save space.

### Captain

This Charm can only be used while you are captaining or piloting the vessel; if
you have no authority, you cannot use it.

### Counterattack

This Charm cannot be used in response to another Charm with the Counterattack
keyword. This prevents infinite Counterattack stacks.

### Decisive-only

This Charm can only be used to enhance a **decisive** attack.

### Dual

This Charm has two different effects, depending on whether you are enhancing
a **withering** or a **decisive** attack.

### Perilous

This Charm cannot be used while you are in crash.

### Restriction

This Charm can only be used as noted in the parenthetical. If the Charm can be
reset to be used again, it will have a **RESET** trigger in the text.

### Stackable

You can use this Charm multiple times to stack its benefits.

### Uniform

This Charm has the same effect whether it is used to enhance a **withering** or
a **decisive** attack.

### Withering-only

This Charm can only be used to enhance a **withering** attack.

### Written-only

This Charm can only be used to enhance a written social action, not a spoken
one.

## Triggers

A trigger is a condition that gives a bonus effect. Triggers are noted in
"**BOLD CAPS** --" and have their bonus listed afterward.

Triggers include:

- **AIM**: This bonus triggers if you have taken an Aim action on the turn
  before;
- **(ELEMENT) AURA**: This bonus triggers if you are in the appropriate aura;
- **RESET**: This Charm with the Restriction keyword can be used again after you
  trigger this condition.
