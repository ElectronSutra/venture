_Your fingers dig in to supple stone, carving out hand and footholds as you_
_ascend._

You may use your reflexive move action to move vertically up any stone or
earthen surface. You succeed automatically without needing a roll. You can even
ascend overhangs. The earth heals behind you.

**Enhancement** (Athletics 3, Essence 2) -- You may choose to leave the
handholds open. They give a +1 non-Charm bonus die to anyone who follows you.

_You lift like a burning ember and your form blurs like smoke. You fly like a_
_shadow along ceilings and walls._

You may move along any surface -- the placid surface of a lake, a rocky wall,
and even upside-down across a ceiling -- even if it couldn't support your
weight. You cannot disengage or withdraw up a wall.

If you end your turn somewhere you could not normally stand, you must use this
Charm again at the start of your next turn or you will fall.

the feat.
