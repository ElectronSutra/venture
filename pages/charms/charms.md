# Charms

A _Charm_ is a system abstraction for the instinctual ability of all Princes of
the Earth to channel their Essence into cool flashy effects. Most Charms do not
exist within the fiction; there are no books of their techniques, but someone
may point at you and say, "Ah, the ancient breath technique of Master Daanxi!"

Most of your magic in _Exalted_ is represented by Charms.

## How to Read a Charm

A Charm is listed with many little bits of detail bundled together. Here is a
guide on how to read them.

### Cost

Charm cost is mostly in motes (m) and willpower (wp). Some combat Charms cost
Initiative (i) or health levels (lethal lhl, bashing bhl, aggravated ahl). One
cost you may see is your anima (a); this represents spending 1 level of glow
from your anima. So 3a means you _must_ be at Iconic to activate the Charm, and
you immediately go back to dim.

### Minimums

A Charm with minimums Archery 3, Essence 2 means you must have Archery 3 and
Essence 2 in order to purchase it.

### Charm Types

Charms come in four types:

- _Simple_ Charms create an action;
- _Supplemental_ Charms enhance the listed action;
- _Reflexive_ Charms can be used at any time;
- _Permanent_ Charms offer a permanent passive effect.

### Keywords

Charm [keywords](/venture/charms/keywords) encode fiddly bits of information
into abstract keywords, like how keywords work in _Magic: the Gathering_. They
just make a particular noteworthy bit of information easier to notate.

### Duration

Most Charms are _instant_, meaning that they happen at the moment that the cost
is spent.

If a Charm has a cost that lasts longer than 1 turn, the cost must be
_committed_. Releasing a commitment is instantaneous and instantly ends the
effect.

### Prerequisite Charms

You must meet _all_ listed prerequisites in order to purchase a Charm.

## Aura

Dragon-Blooded Charms are all aligned to an element. This element is indicated
by having an elemental keyword.

Dragon-Blooded can enter a state called an _aura_ by only using Charms of one
element during their turn; at the end of that turn, they enter that element's
aura. Lot-Casting Atemi has a little box that keeps track of it for you.

Some Charms are stronger when you are in the appropriate aura. Some Charms can
_only_ be used in their aura.

### Aesthetics

When you enter an aura, your anima changes. If your aura aligns with your
Aspect, then it gets more intense -- a fire becomes a bonfire, or clouds become
storming thunder. If it is a different element, your elements blend together --
so Fire/Earth may become a volcano, or Wood/Water may manifest as thick kelp.

## Signature Charms

Every Ability has five Signature Charms. A Signature Charm is extra powerful
and flashy. You can have 1 Signature Charm for each Ability, in any element.

## Excellencies

The last and most important note about Charms is the _Excellency_.

An Excellency is a basic workhorse Charm. Every Ability has one. An Excellency
allows you to buy dice for motes 1-for-1 or successes for motes 1-for-2. These
Charms are often not the most efficient option, but they are incredibly
flexible. Savannah can elaborate on how useful they are.

You can only add (Ability + Specialty) total dice on a roll, or half that many
successes.
