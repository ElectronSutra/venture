> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Sail 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Pilot, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your vessel races across the waves like a bird diving through foam._

Whenever you make a Sail roll where your ship's Speed is included, reroll (lower
of Wits or Speed, min 1) failed dice that didn't come up as a 1.

### Ocean-Darting Maneuver

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Sail 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Navigate a Hazard); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Pilot, Water
>

_Under your skillful command, your ship threads the needle's eye to find just_
_the right course for what you need._

Double 9s.

### Dragon Mariner Attitude

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Sail 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your reputation precedes you, Captain -- but only the reputation you desire._

Choose one:

- CAROUSING: While ashore, you radiate the aura of one searching for vice in
  port. People who provide such vices will seek you out. You can easily find
  information on dens of vice.
- HEROISM: Everyone who looks at you knows you're a nautical hero. Those in need
  of such a person instinctively trust you -- treat them as if they have a minor
  Tie of trust toward you.
- LEADERSHIP: All sailors under your command are treated as if they have a minor
  Tie of respect or admiration toward you. You add one bonus success to Inspire
  or command them. Trivial seafarers on other ships are affected likewise.
- MENACING: You are threatening. You get one automatic success to Threaten, and
  for every point that your Appearance exceeds your target's, you get 1 bonus
  die.

### Deck-Striding Prana

> **Cost**: 3m, 2i; **Mins**: Sail 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Movement On a Ship); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Perilous, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Dragon Mariner Attitude](#dragon-mariner-attitude)

_You cannot be tossed about by mere waves._

Add (Sail) bonus dice. You may use your reflexive move to ascend 1 range band up
rigging, ladders, decks, etc. without needing to roll.

**WATER AURA** -- You don't have to pay the Initiative cost and this Charm isn't
Perilous.

### Hurricane-Predicting Glance

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Sail 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Dragon Mariner Attitude](#dragon-mariner-attitude)

_Your coat flares with Air Essence and your eyes flash with lightning as you_
_stare into the sky and see the weather yet to come._

Roll ([Perception or Intelligence] + Sail) against difficulty 1 for home waters,
3 for well-traveled waters, or 5 for unmapped seas. If you succeed, you
perfectly predict the weather for the next 24 hours, no matter how freakish.

This doesn't work against weather control magic.

If you foresee dangerous weather, you gain a Sail specialty in avoiding or
navigating that weather. This specialty lasts until the weather has passed. You
can only have 1 specialty from this Charm at a time.

## Essence 2

### Old Salt Spirit

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Sail 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Mute, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Dragon Mariner Attitude](#dragon-mariner-attitude)

_Your experience wells up inside you and steels you against the calls of_
_sirens or the threats of pirates._

Get +1 Resolve against fear while on the ship, or against any influence that
would cause you to abandon it or put it into a dangerous situation. If you work
in a description of a previos adventure into the stunt, the bonus goes up to
+(Sail/2, round up) Resolve.

### Seven Seas Wind-Luring Chanty

> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Hurricane-Predicting Glance](#hurricane-predicting-glance)

_Your voice is a calming doldrum in the wicked stormy winds, or a mighty breeze_
_that drives your ship forward._

Roll (Charisma + Sail) when you face inclement weather. Every 2 successes you
get reduces the inclement weather penalty by 1.

If you use this Charm in clear weather, you summon up a wind that boosts your
Speed by 1 and drives you in any direction you choose.

### Sturdy Bulkhead Concentration

> **Cost**: 4m, 1a; **Mins**: Sail 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Restriction (1/scene), Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Ocean-Darting Maneuver](#ocean-darting-maneuver)

_Your anima lashes out like vines, holding the ship together as it is buffeted_
_by harm._

Whenever your ship suffers damage, roll (Essence + 2) non-Charm dice. Add these
successes to your roll to have avoided the damage. If the roll now succeeds,
your ship takes half the damage, rounded down, that it would have before.

**RESET** -- Succeed at a difficulty 4+ Sail roll.
