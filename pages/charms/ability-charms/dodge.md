# Dodge Charms

## Excellency

### Threshold Warding Stance

> **Cost**: 2m/+1 Evasion _or_ success; **Mins**: Dodge 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll) _or_ Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Excellency, Fire, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are as nimble as an ember rising from a fire._

Increase your Evasion by 1 per 2m spent, or add 1 automatic success to a Dodge
roll per 2m spent.

You ignore all environmental penalties to your Evasion or the Dodge roll.

## Essence 1

### Flickering Candle Meditation

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You flit about the battlefield like a flickering candle-flame._

Every 1 your opponent rolls allows you to ignore 1 point of penalty, up to
(Essence) total points.

### Nimble Zephyr Defense

> **Cost**: 1m; **Mins**: Dodge 4, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_You twist with the grace of the wind, slipping a hair's breadth from danger._

Declare this Charm in response to being attacked. As long as your attacker
rolled at least one 1, he has to beat your Evasion to hit you (as opposed to the
normal roll, which is "match or beat" your Evasion). If you dodge successfully,
your attacker loses 1 Initiative.

**AIR AURA** -- You gain the Initiative your attacker loses.

***

### Heat-of-Battle Advance

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Disengage); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are a raging forest fire. As you retreat on one flank, you advance on_
_another._

For every 10 you roll, roll an additional non-Charm bonus die.

You don't have to pay Initiative to disengage, as long as you move into close
range of another enemy.

## Essence 2

### Hopping Firecracker Evasion

> **Cost**: 3m, 2i; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_Your feet erupt in a plume of fire and sparks as you leap about._

When someone tries to hit you and fails by at least 2 successes, you may move
one range band in any direction -- including upwards.

***

### Virtuous Negation Defense

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Dodge 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Uniform, Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Hopping Firecracker Evasion](#hopping-firecracker-evasion)

_Like reeds bending in the wind, you appear between your ally and harm at just_
_the right moment._

If someone attacks an ally of yours within close range, you can apply your
Evasion to the attack as if you were using [defend other](/venture/systems/combat/actions#defend-other/).

Only pay 2m if you are defending one of your sworn kin.

**WOOD AURA** -- Defend an ally within short range instead. You reflexively move
to their range band; it doesn't count as your reflexive move for your turn.

***

### Light-as-Clouds Method

> **Cost**: -- (+4m); **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: Air/Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Hopping Firecracker Evasion](#hopping-firecracker-evasion)

_You twist incoming force back against its attacker, turning their wasted_
_momentum into a burst of speed._

You may pay 4m extra when you use Hopping Firecracker Evasion to reflexively
roll to Disengage. Add bonus dice equal to the Overwhelming of your enemy's
weapon (the stronger their attack, the easier it is for you to escape).

**AIR/FIRE AURA** -- It costs no Initiative to Disengage using this Charm.

***

### Ember-Amid-Smoke Misdirection

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Dodge 5, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Aura, Fire, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_They try to hit you, but you are only smoke; and where there's smoke, there's_
_fire._

Gain +1 Evasion.

If you dodge successfully, your attacker suffers (Essence) dice of unsoakable
**withering** damage. You don't steal their Initiative though.

***

### Salvo-to-Silt Technique

> **Cost**: 2m, 1i; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Uniform, Perilous, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_Your anima flares up in front of you, forming a protective barrier against_
_incoming attacks._

Your attacker gets -(your Anima level) on their ranged attack roll against your
Evasion. If he hits you, he reduces his damage by 1 for each 1 he rolls, up to
(your Anima) damage.

If you evade an attack with physical projectiles, they get caught in your anima,
so you can pick them up and use them for your own attack, wield them as
improvised weapons, kick them back flying, or any other stunt use you can come
up with. If your anima fades to dim, they all fall to the ground.

***

### Stone-Sculpting Fortification

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Dodge 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Take Cover); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Earth
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_Your anima sinks into the ground in great white-tinged waves, raising up_
_barricades from the earth itself._

Roll (Dexterity + Dodge) against difficulty 2 to raise barriers from any earth
or stone nearby. If you succeed, you take cover behind it, gaining light cover
from the newly-risen barriers. If an earth or stone protrusion would normally
give you light cover, this Charm enhances it to heavy cover. The barriers raised
and fortified by this Charm are permanent.

**EARTH AURA** -- Double 9s on your rolls for this Charm.

***

### Ascending Ember Trick

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air/Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Heat-of-Battle Advance](#heat-of-battle-advance)

_You tumble with flame gouting from your feet, the force helping you to right_
_yourself as you land._

Take the "rise from prone" action reflexively, and out of turn, if you so
choose. This takes your movement action for the round or the next round if you
act out of turn.
