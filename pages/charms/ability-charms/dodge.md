# Dodge Charms

## Excellency

### Threshold Warding Stance

> **Cost**: 2m/+1 Evasion _or_ success; **Mins**: Dodge 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll) _or_ Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Excellency, Fire, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are as nimble as an ember rising from a fire._

Increase your Evasion by 1 per 2m spent, or add 1 automatic success to a Dodge
roll per 2m spent.

You ignore all environmental penalties to your Evasion or the Dodge roll.

## Essence 1

### Flickering Candle Meditation

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You flit about the battlefield like a flickering candle-flame._

Every 1 your opponent rolls allows you to ignore 1 point of penalty, up to
(Essence) total points.

### Heat-of-Battle Advance

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Disengage); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are a raging forest fire. As you retreat on one flank, you advance on_
_another._

For every 10 you roll, roll an additional non-Charm bonus die.

You don't have to pay Initiative to disengage, as long as you move into close
range of another enemy.

## Essence 2

### Hopping Firecracker Evasion

> **Cost**: 3m, 2i; **Mins**: Dodge 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_Your feet erupt in a plume of fire and sparks as you leap about._

When someone tries to hit you and fails by at least 2 successes, you may move
one range band in any direction -- including upwards.

***

### Virtuous Negation Defense

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Dodge 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Uniform, Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Hopping Firecracker Evasion](#hopping-firecracker-evasion)

_Like reeds bending in the wind, you appear between your ally and harm at just_
_the right moment._

If someone attacks an ally of yours within close range, you can apply your
Evasion to the attack as if you were using [defend other](/venture/systems/combat/actions#defend-other/).

Only pay 2m if you are defending one of your sworn kin.

**WOOD AURA** -- Defend an ally within short range instead. You reflexively move
to their range band; it doesn't count as your reflexive move for your turn.

***

### Ember-Amid-Smoke Misdirection

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Dodge 5, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Aura, Fire, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flickering Candle Meditation](#flickering-candle-meditation)

_They try to hit you, but you are only smoke; and where there's smoke, there's_
_fire._

Gain +1 Evasion.

If you dodge successfully, your attacker suffers (Essence) dice of unsoakable
**withering** damage. You don't steal their Initiative though.
