# Bureaucracy Charms

## Excellency

### Geese-Flying-South Administration

> **Cost**: 2m/success; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Excellency, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_The flow of systems is as intuitive to you as the flow of water is to a river._

Add 1 automatic success to the roll for every 2m spent. The roll gets
disappearing 6s.

## Essence 1

### Finding the Water's Depths

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your eyes sparkle with energy as you stare into your target's soul, spying the_
_ebbs and flows of his desire._

Read Intentions on your target. Success reveals the amount and type of payment
he would require in order to take a course of action. You also learn his
strongest Intimacy related to the bargain.

### Testing the Waters

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Finding the Water's Depths](#finding-the-waters-depths)

_You understand your target's politics better than they do themselves._

This Charm functions the same as Finding the Water's Depths, except that instead
of a price it reveals how the target intends to vote on an upcoming issue in
which they have a say. It also reveals his strongest Intimacy driving his vote.

## Essence 2

### Benevolent Master's Blessing

> **Cost**: 1m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Indefinite
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your might is so abundant that a mere token of your authority is enough to_
_make your servant stand out._

Mark a servant with an obvious token -- you may give him a swirling black magic
tattoo if you don't want to give him a physical token. You can cancel the token
at any time by releasing your commitment.

As long as he has the token, everyone who sees it instinctively knows that he is
your emissary and can negotiate on your behalf. He also gains a temporary +1
bonus on all Bureaucracy rolls related to following your commands or pursuing
your best interests.

### Dashing Brook Method

> **Cost**: 2m, 1wp; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Project roll); **Duration**: One task
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Benevolent Master's Blessing](#benevolent-masters-blessing)

_The power of your leadership is a tsunami wave that clears obstacles to_
_progress._

Multiply the speed of the project by (highest of Charisma, Manipulation, or
Intelligence). This cannot speed a task that would normally take longer than
(Essence) years.

### Unshakable Mountain Management

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Earth
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Testing the Waters](#testing-the-waters)

_Your presence is a barrier that protects people from their own corrupt intent._

Activate this Charm in response to social influence you want to oppose. That
influence must be attempting to convince the target(s) to betray an organization
they are part of, or to abuse their position within that organization.

Anyone subject to that influence gets +1 Resolve against it.

**EARTH AURA** -- Get +(your Essence / 2, round up) Resolve instead.

### Water-Stained Ledger

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Conceal evidence); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Beneath your skillful fingers, crimes and debts sink below the surface like_
_pebbles into a placid lake..._

Add disappearing 5s and 6s. The evidence you are concealing must relate to
a bureaucratic process such as embezzlement or laundering money.

Anyone attempting to discover your deception must use (lower of Bureaucracy or
Investigation).

### Shells-for-Silver Ruse

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Water-Stained Ledger](#water-stained-ledger)

_The calm surface of the ocean can conceal sunken treasure or rotted carcasses_
_of dead boats. Only diving down can reveal which._

Choose one:

- POVERTY: Others perceive you as completely destitute, as if you had Resources
  0. If you have obvious objects of finery, they perceive you as if you had
  Resources-1.
- WEALTHY: Others perceive you as if you had Resources+1. If your Resources is
  already 5, you are perceived to unimaginably wealthy.

You may leverage this imaginary status as thought it were a Minor Intimacy.

### Thoughtful Gift Technique

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Bargain Action); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Finding the Water's Depths](#finding-the-waters-depths)

_What a coincidence, that you seem to know just what this person needs..._

If you have already used Finding the Water's Depths to discover a person's
price, you may use this Charm to double 9s on a bargain roll which leverages
that price.
