_You coax water to flow as you do, whipping it out in a flowing tentacle that_
_you can use as an extra limb._

You can only activate this Charm if you are within close range of a source of
water. If you have no source of water, you can expend 1 level of your anima

You create a tendril of water and make a grapple against an enemy out to short
range. If you win control of the grapple, you drag them into close range.

**WATER AURA** -- The tendril can go out to medium range.

_Water is persistent, wearing stones down over time. Your fists boil with black_
_Water Essence; your opponent is about to learn this lesson the hard way._
