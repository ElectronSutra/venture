_Your radiant presence is comforting to the wild beasts. They bow their heads_
_to you after a few moments of glory._

You do not instantly fully tame it, only convince it to let you ride it and obey
your commands while mounted. Full taming requires extended interaction and can
be accelerated with the use of Survival Charms.
