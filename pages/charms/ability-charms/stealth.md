# Stealth Charms

## Excellency

### Distracting Breeze Meditation

> **Cost**: 2m/success; **Mins**: Stealth 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air, Balanced, Excellency, Mute
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_The wind itself conspires to keep you hidden, blowing curtains to cover your_
_movement or extinguishing torches as you pass._

Add 1 success per 2m spent.

## Essence 1

### Vanishing Wind-Body Technique

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Stealth 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are a whisper of a ghost on a memory of a breeze._

Ignore 1 point of the -3 penalty for using Stealth in combat. Any effect that
relies on air motion to detect you (such as
[All-Encompassing Earth Sense](/venture/charms/abilities/awareness#all-encompassing-earth-sense/)'s
Air variant) cannot detect you. People can still hear you though so be careful.

**AIR AURA** -- Ignore (Essence/2, round up) points of penalty instead.

### Flowing Shadow Stance

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Stealth 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Establishing Stealth); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Vanishing Wind-Body Technique](#vanishing-wind-body-technique)

_You slip through the battlefield like a persistent stream, always somewhere_
_other than where your foes are looking._

Get disappearing 6s. If you're in combat and succeed, you get 1i if you beat the
Awareness of all your foes.

**WATER AURA** -- Instead of just gaining 1i, you can steal 1i from any opponent
whose Awareness you beat.

### Soundless Action Prana

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Stealth 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Until next turn
>
> **Keywords**: Air, Mute
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Vanishing Wind-Body Technique](#vanishing-wind-body-technique)

_Your soul is a vortex, pulling sound inside yourself. You glide through the_
_world with nary a whisper._

For every 10 you roll, reroll a failed die that didn't come up as a 1. You can't
be detected by hearing; if your opponent has magical hearing, they take -2
instead.

## Essence 2

### Shimmering Heat-Mirage Tactic

> **Cost**: 4m, 2i; **Mins**: Stealth 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flowing Shadow Stance](#flowing-shadow-stance)

_You fade and fuzz like a mirage in the desert. Your movements trail_
_after-images that your opponents cannot follow._

Get +2 Evasion.

If a non-trivial opponent attacks you and doesn't roll any 1s, this Charm ends
immediately, even if they didn't hit.

**FIRE AURA** -- They must both avoid rolling any 1s _and_ manage to roll at
least one 10.
