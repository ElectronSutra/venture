Make a distract gambit. If successful, inflict a -1 mobility penalty on the
distracted character for the rest of the scene. At the end of every round, the
target loses 1i which you do not gain. He or his allies may overcome this hazard
with a difficulty 3 miscellaneous action.

If your target is a minor undead, they are instantly reduced to dust; this may
cost +1wp if they are sufficiently important.

further than close range from the bow.

your damage roll instead of your attack roll.
