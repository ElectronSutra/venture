automatic success on their movement rolls, an automatic success on ranged
attack rolls made from medium distance or further, and they get +1 Evasion
against incoming attacks.

If the enhanced battlegroup has elite drill, their elite drill grants +3
non-Charm bonus dice to rally, move, or order ranged attacks from medium range
or further.

If you are fighting under a stratagem you have successfully enacted in strategic
combat, you can use this Charm reflexively instead of as Simple.

### Tiger-and-Dragon Combination

> **Cost**: 7m, 1wp; **Mins**: War 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Decisive-only, Restriction (1/day)
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: Any combination of five Archery, Brawl, Martial Arts,
> Melee, Thrown, or War Charms

_You and your partner move in perfect synchronicity. With blinding speed and_
_terrifying prowess, you and your ally strike a blow from the depths of the_
_Earth._

When you purchase this Charm, you must spend the learn time with a training
montage of you and a single ally in which the two of you develop a signature
combo.

You may use this Charm if your ally is within short range of you. If they are at
short range, they can reflexively move to close range from you. This doesn't
count as their movement action for the turn. You cannot use this Charm if your
ally is too far away or if they are Crashed.

Then, you and your ally each make a **decisive** attack against your target, and
each of you deals damage based on the _higher_ of your two commitments. Both
attacks apply their Onslaught before either of you rolls. This attack counts as
your attack action, but not your ally's.

> Timing Clarification Example: Your target has Onslaught -1. You use this
> Charm. His Onslaught increases to -3, then the first of you attacks, then the
> second.

**SPECIAL** -- Participating as an ally counts as your 1/day use of this Charm.

**REPURCHASE** -- Gain a new combo with a new ally.
