# Investigation Charms

## Excellency

### Indisputable Physical Analysis Technique

> **Cost**: 2m/success; **Mins**: Investigation 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Excellency, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your presence washes away falsity, leaving behind only the truth._

Add 1 automatic success per 2m spent.

Add disappearing 6s.

## Essence 1

### Tampering-Detection Technique

> **Cost**: 1m; **Mins**: Investigation 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Case Scene); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_The crime scene ripples with watery Essence as all fraud becomes clear to you._

Choose one:

- SCENE: Immediately learn if anyone has tried to conceal evidence here.
- OBJECT: Immediately learn if anyone has tampered with it in the last
  (Essence + Investigation) hours.

In both cases, you learn of the deception, but you do not automatically learn
the identity of the perp.

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Investigation 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Profile Character); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Under the exacting gaze of a dragon, your target's sins bubble to the surface._

Add (Essence) non-Charm bonus dice. If you succeed, you gain an Investigation
specialty in the target. This specialty doesn't expire, but you can only have
one at a time.

## Essence 2

>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Special*); **Duration**: Instant

_No one washes blood from their hands when a Prince is in pursuit._

**SPECIAL** -- This Charm can enhance any Awareness, Investigation, or Survival
roll to track a character who has rolled Larceny within the past (Essence)
hours.

Double 9s.

You may determine the exact nature of the target's guilt through a profile
character action.

### Heart-Maze Navigation

> **Cost**: 1m, 1wp; **Mins**: Investigation 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Profile Character); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: Scent-of-Crime Method

_Your presence beats against the target like waves on shore, and slowly they_
_are worn down. In that moment... Yes, there! The answers you were looking for!_

If the target has an Intimacy that would compel them to reveal information to
you, that Intimacy penalizes their Guile as though it were their Resolve.

**WATER AURA** -- You can profile a character instantly.

### Revelation-of-Associates Hunch

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Investigation 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Scent-of-Crime Method](#scent-of-crime-method)

_The magnitude of the crime is obvious to you as a burning sun._

Roll an additional non-Charm bonus die for each 10 you roll.

When you uncover evidence of a crime, you feel it as a sensation of flashing
heat. The intensity of the heat depends on the size of the cartel. A lone crim
or small operation barely registers at all; a conspiracy of hundreds burns like
a bonfire at your touch.

> **Cost**: 4m, 1wp; **Mins**: Investigation 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: (Essence) days
>
> **Keywords**: Water/Wood

_Catching a hint of the reek of crime, you are able to pursue the scent to its_
_source. The scent appears to you as hazy glowing trails hanging in the air._

Make a difficulty 3 Case Scene roll with double 9s to investigate a piece of
evidence. This difficulty may go up depending on how old the evidence is.

If you succeed, you are able to visualize the scent and follow it. If you are
familiar with the scent you identify it immediately and automatically.

You get double 9s on Awareness, Investigation, or Survival rolls to track your
mark. If the scent is present in a scene, you will be told automatically if you
should case the scene or profile a character.

oppose Larceny.

**WATER AURA** -- Also add an automatic success.
