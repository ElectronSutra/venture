### Elemental Bolt Attack

> **Cost**: 4m (+1a); **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Dual
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

Make a **withering** or **decisive** attack with (Dexterity + [Archery or
Thrown]) out to short range, or medium if you spend 1a. This can be enhanced by
Charms of the appropriate Ability.

This Charm has your element when you first buy it:

- AIR: Your blast is lightning. Do Lethal damage and ignore (higher of Essence
  or 3) Soak or (Essence) Hardness from metal armor.
- EARTH: Your bolt is a cascade of rocks or a blast of sand. Do Bashing damage
  and give it the Smashing tag.
- FIRE: Your bolt is a blast of smoke or flame. It does Lethal damage and
  doubles 10s on **decisive** damage rolls.
- WATER: Your bolt is a flood of water or cracking tentacle. Do Bashing damage
  and give it the [Flexible](/venture/gear/weaponry#other-tags) and
  [Disarming](/venture/gear/weaponry#other-tags) tags.
- WOOD: Your bolt is a lash of vines or thorns. Do Lethal damage. **Decisive**
  attacks are poisoned (damage 1i/round (B in crash); duration (Essence + 5);
  penalty -1).

You can purchase two additional elements as a Charm purchase.

## Essence 2

### Elemental Sheath

> **Cost**: 1m (+1a); **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

Banish your weapon into a display of an element. You can have your sword blow
away like dust in a gust of wind, have your spear turn translucent and
disappear into a lake, bury your bow by plunging it into soil, etc.

You may use this same Charm to withdraw the weapon from a display of the same
element.

Your anima always counts as "an appropriate elemental dispaly" for your Aspect's
element.

### Dragon-Graced Weapon

> **Cost**: -- (+1m); **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Elemental Sheath](#elemental-sheath)

You may pay a 1m surcharge when you summon your weapon back using Elemental
Sheath to gain one of the following effects, based on the elemental display you
retrieved it from:

- AIR: The weapon is deadly cold. Anyone you hit with a **decisive** attack
  takes -1 on all physical rolls until their next turn.
- EARTH: The weapon is heavy with the shiny Essence of Earth. It gains the
  Smashing tag. If it already has the Smashing tag, its smash attacks deal 1
  extra die of damage.
- FIRE: The weapon is wreathed in flames. It gets +1 Overwhelming.
- WATER: The weapon is fluid and flexible. It gets the Flexible and Disarming
  tags. If it already had both, add 1 bonus die to grapple attack rolls.
- WOOD: The weapon is wrapped in vines and blossoms. It gets the Disarming tag.
  If it already has the Disarming tag, add 1 bonus die to Disarm gambits.

### Elemental Aegis

> **Cost**: 3m (+1a); **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

You may banish any attuned jade armor into a display of an element. It melts
into a waterfall, flies away as smoke as you walk through a bonfire, or fades
into a stone pillar, that sort of thing.

You can use this Charm again to withdraw it from any manifestation of the same
element. You don it immediately with a cool enough stunt.

Your anima always counts as an "appropriate elemental display" for your Aspect's
element.
