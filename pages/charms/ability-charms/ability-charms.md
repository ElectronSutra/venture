away like dust in a gust of wind, have your spear turn translucent and
disappear into a lake, bury your bow by plunging it into soil, etc.

You may use this same Charm to withdraw the weapon from a display of the same
element.

Your anima always counts as "an appropriate elemental dispaly" for your Aspect's
element.

  takes -1 on all physical rolls until their next turn.

>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are a master of many Artifacts; your Essence permeates them. Your arsenal_
_is a part of you, and you a part of it._

Commit the full-cost attunement of an Artifact weapon. Reduce the attunement
cost of further Artifact weapons to 1m each. This doesn't stack with any other
discount. If you end your full-cost attunement for any reason, you must commit
motes to one of your remaining weapons sufficient to bring it to the full
commitment.

>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

You may banish any attuned jade armor into a display of an element. It melts
into a waterfall, flies away as smoke as you walk through a bonfire, or fades
into a stone pillar, that sort of thing.

You can use this Charm again to withdraw it from any manifestation of the same
element. You don it immediately with a cool enough stunt.

Your anima always counts as an "appropriate elemental display" for your Aspect's
element.

This Charm can be purchased as a Favored Charm.
