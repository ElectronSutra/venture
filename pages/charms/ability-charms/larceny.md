_Flavor._

Roll ([Dexterity or Appearance] + Larceny) to a single small item on your
person. It must small enough to fit in your palm. A set of tools counts as one
item. No one can roll to oppose this concealment unless they are within short
range of you or use magic -- someone can be staring you down and they won't
notice unless they're close enough.

You can stack up to (Dexterity) uses of this Charm to hide different items.

> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_The subtle ripples of eyes on your backs stand out to you as clear as day._

Roll (Perception + Larceny). If you get at least 1 success, you instantly and
instinctively know if you are being watched and by how many people.

**ENHANCE** (Larceny 4, Essence 2) -- You also know the precise location of each
observer if your roll beats their (higher of Stealth or Guile).

_You grow like a weed among the groups you choose to be part of._

To use this Charm, you must spend at least 1 hour interacting with a criminal
element -- a crime family, gang, etc. -- that you are at least passingly
familiar with.

Add a temporary Larceny specialty related to the criminal element. This
specialty is indefinite, but you can only have one at a time.

> [Observer Awareness Method](#observer-awareness-method)

_Your fingers flow like water into other peoples' pockets._

Double 9s. Increase the difficulty of noticing your theft by (Essence) unless
your target uses magic. In that case, even if they defeat you, they will need
(Essence) threshold successes to detect that _you_, specifically, were
responsible for the theft.

### Dragon's Hidden Treasure

> **Cost**: 1m; **Mins**: Larceny 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Earth
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Naked Thief Style](#naked-thief-style)

_You strike stone with a careful, deliberate series of blows. It ripples under_
_your touch and becomes as supple as fresh dough._

Conceal a held object in soil, stone, metal, or similar earthen materials. The
earth is not displaced. The earthen receptacle must be at least as large as the
concealed object; so you could hide a sword inside a statue or a castle wall,
but not inside a coin or gemstone.

You can retrieve any object hidden using this Charm by using the Charm a second
time at the same location. You can also use this Charm to steal something that
someone _else_ has hidden with it, if you can find where they put it...

### Face-Stealing Reflection

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Larceny 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flowing Body Disguse](#flowing-body-disguise),
> [Observer Awareness Method](#observer-awareness-method)

_You slip from one identity to another with a watery sheen of the air._

Roll Read Intentions with (Perception + Larceny) against a target. If you
succeed, you learn the identity of a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance will
be someone that you know well enough to disguise yourself as. If no such person
exists, then instead you learn with absolute confidence that no such person
exists.

**WATER AURA** -- You then get double 9s on your disguise roll if you disguise
yourself as the mutual acquaintance.

***

### Bramble Purse Technique

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Larceny 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One hour
>
> **Keywords**: Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Observer Awareness Method](#observer-awareness-method)

_You line your pockets and glove your hands with invisible poison thorns of_
_magic. No one steals from_ you!

Activate in response to a roll to pickpocket or disarm you.

That roll loses (Essence) dice. This is explicitly not a penalty, so they can't
use magic to try and ignore it.

If they fail their roll, they suffer 1 automatic level of lethal damage.

***

### Evidence-Erasing Tide

_ever there._

Complete the roll instantly. Add a non-Charm bonus success.

>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Flowing Body Disguise](#flowing-body-disguise)

_Your face, body, and identity are so fluid you barely even have need of a_
_disguise._

Roll to disguise yourself. You do not need any makeup, props, or equipment in
order to do so. It takes you no more than a minute to complete your disguise.

If you have suitable tools, you get double 9s on your disguise roll.

_No one outcheats a cheater._

Activate this Charm in response to someone attempting to cheat you in a game or
someone using Larceny against you.

Read Intentions on the target using (Perception + Larceny). If you succeed, you
learn the identity of the cheater and the nature of the cheat. If you fail, you
know that someone has cheated, but you don't know who or how.

A disguise does not trigger this Charm unless you see them putting on the
disguise.
