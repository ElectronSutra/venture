If they have any lethal levels, every success converts a level of lethal damage
into bashing, letting it heal much quicker.

If your patient only has bashing damage, you may heal their wounds. You heal one
level of bashing damage instantly if you pass a Medicine roll with difficulty
(their Wound Penalty + 1).

After being healed with this Charm, your patient must rest for a full day before
they can be healed again.

_Your master of herbs and animal substances means you are never without tools._

You always count as having appropriate tools to treat ailments as long as you

_Even the most grievous wounds close beneath a Prince's careful touch._

each success converts a point of aggravated damage to lethal; once all
aggravated damage is cured, further successes turn lethal damage to bashing as
usual.

### Flesh-Sealing Flame Technique

may pay +2m (or 2i in combat, if you choose) to double 9s and complete the
treatment instantly.

If you use this Charm on mortals, it also automatically staunches bleeding and
prevents infection. The treatment is painful, so they increase their wound
penalty by -1 for (6 - patient's Stamina) rounds.

You can use this Charm to enhance a Rally for Numbers roll as the leader of a
battle group. Roll (Intelligence + War) with (Medicine) non-Charm bonus dice.

Using this Charm changes Wound-Closing Technique's Aspect to Fire.
