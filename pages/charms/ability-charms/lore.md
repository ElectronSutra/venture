## Excellency

### Graceful Insight-Gathering Study

_Your wisdom is a breeze that blows away the fog in your students' minds._

Make an Instill roll with ([Charisma or Intelligence] + Lore) to make your
target extra receptive to learning. This emotion acts as the equivalent of a
Major Intimacy, "I must seek education."

If you leverage this emotional state to convince the target to study with you or
accept your tutelage, the cost of resisting increases by 1wp.

beneath a waterfall, watching the sky, etc. This Charm's element depends on the
display.

At the end, you may roll ([Any mental Attribute] + [Bureaucracy, Investigation,
Lore, Medicine, Survival, or War]) with a single automatic success to introduce
a fact related to the Charm's element. Watching the sky lets you introduce a
fact about the weather; etc.

_Your understanding of the elements allows you to inspire them in others._

Touch another Prince. You may transfer your aura to him, as well as up to
(Essence x 3) of your own motes (either pool).

The granted motes may only be spent on Balanced Charms or Charms of the same
element as the aura you transferred. If your target doesn't have enough motes
available, he has to spend them before his next turn or the extras go away.

**REPURCHASE** (Lore 5, Essence 2) -- You can also transfer 1a in addition to
the aura.

_You draw on the power of the world to replenish yourself._

Once per day when you use Elemental Concentration Trance, you may pay 1lhl or
1wp to gain 2 motes for every threshold success. These motes can only be spent
on Charms that match the element of the display you were concentrating upon.

If you know [Dragon Kin Empowerment](#dragon-kin-empowerment), you may use this

_Your tutelage encourages your students to transcend their boundaries._

Any student under your tutelage may buy an [advancement](/venture/character-creation/advancement)
out-of-cycle, allowing them to get it _now_ rather than _then_; they cannot
pick that same advancement the next time it is available.
