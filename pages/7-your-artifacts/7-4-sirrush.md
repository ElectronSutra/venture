# Sirrush

## Blue Jade Devil Caster, Artifact 4

The island city of Wu-Jian is a critical port for the Realm's expansion into the
West. Discovered by Realm explorers a little over a century ago, Wu-Jian was
quickly acquired as a satrapy and now serves as a nexus for all travel between
the Isle and the Western satrapies.

Most of the island is covered in slums, thousands of buildings stacked on top of
one another for a chance to get to the sunlight. The depths of the city are lost
in darkness, lit by lanterns, the sunlight blocked by the soaring cityscape
above. Around the mountain at the heart of the island, Dynastic mansions cling
to the rock and stone to stay out of the reach of the criminals below.

House Sesus makes good trade in Wu-Jian. Here, force is currency, and blood is
contract ink. The Sesus enforcers roam the regions near the Dynastic compounds,
extorting protection money from Realm interests to keep their business safe. In
the slums, contracted criminals ensure that Sesus interests are advanced through
extortion and the occasional assassination.

Sesus Root was posted here. Publicly, he was administering an expansion of a
Sesus business interest. In reality, the House was arranging for meetings with
some of the Criminal Lords to discuss certain... Subtle elements of Sesus
foreign policy.

During his posting, Sesus Root was involved in a major escapade involving
Sirrush. Fished from the mud by children searching for coins, the blue jade
devil caster is of unknown origin but undeniable value. By various twists and
turns the devil caster came to rest in Sesus Root's hands, and he had a mighty
and thrilling adventure to smuggle it back home.

## Aesthetics

Sirrush is a beautiful and elegant flintlock, slightly larger than most of its
peers. The wood is a dark walnut lacquer and the metal components a steely azure
jade alloy.

The whole of the pistol is wrapped with a white jade inlay of a
strange creature: a long-bodied hound with the hind legs of an eagle, the
forelegs of a lion, and a pair of curled horns. Study of the creature revealed
that it is called a _mushkhusshu_ (moosh-koo-shoo), a hunting beast from the far
East.

When you use Sirrush's Evocations, the creature's eyes begin to glow with
cerulean energy, and the gonne twists and comes alive in your grip.

## Evocations of Sirrush

All devil casters gain the following effect:

> **Reload** -- Spend 1m to reload this weapon reflexively. The firedust flies
> from your pouch to the barrel as if by magic.

While Sesus Root is attuned to Sirrush, it gains the Concealable tag. You get
[Lightning-Draw Method](#lightning-draw-method) for free as long as you are
attuned.

***

## Essence 1

### Lightning Draw Method

> **Cost**: --; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisites**: None

_Sirrush leaps to hand, eager to be wielded in battle._

On the first round of combat, you may choose to treat your Initiative as (Wits)
higher than it actually is, but if you do so, you _must_ make an attack.

***

### Thorn Among Roses

> **Cost**: -- (+2m); **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Lightning Draw Method](#lightning-draw-method)

_Leave it to Root to make an entrance._

Whenever you use Lightning Draw Method, you may pay 2m and make a reflexive
Instill action to instill fear or awe in the target plus any other foe within
close range of your target. Apply your one roll against all of their Resolves.

## Essence 2

### Storm-Dueling Maneuver

> **Cost**: 5m, 2i; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Clash, Uniform
>
> **Prerequisites**: [Lightning Draw Method](#lightning-draw-method)

_The watchful eye of the Sirrush protects you even when you don't know you're_
_in danger._

Use this Evocation if you are the target of a surprise attack from close or
short range. This has no effect against ambushes.

You clash the attack with a **withering** or **decisive** attack and instantly
draw and ready Sirrush. This doesn't count as your combat action for the turn.

***

### Fiery Gale Barrage

> **Cost**: 4m, 1i; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Attack Against Cover); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Uniform
>
> **Prerequisites**: [Storm-Dueling Maneuver](#storm-dueling-maneuver)

_Sirrush's fiery breath is eager to expose the hidden._

In addition to opposing your target's Defense, this attack roll also counts as
a feat of demolition against the target's cover, as long as the feat doesn't
require greater than Strength 5. If you successfully destroy the cover, it gives
no benefit to your target.

***

### Forked-Lightning Flame Attack

> **Cost**: 10m, 3i, 1wp; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only, Restriction (1/scene)
>
> **Prerequisites**: [Fiery Gale Barrage](#fiery-gale-barrage)

_The beast along Sirrush's sides opens its mouth to spew fire. In a cascade of_
_shining blue-white fire, the beast seems to leap to life and burn._

Roll a **decisive** attack against up to (Wits) enemies in a 180-degree arc in
front of you. This can't target enemies behind cover; you may use Fiery Gale
Barrage to destroy their cover first, though. Divide your Initiative evenly
among all targets hit, rounded up, to a maximum of (Essence + 3) against each
target.

Against a battle group, there's no maximum damage and you double 10s on your
damage roll.

You must make an ammunition check after using this Evocation.

**RESET** -- Crash a non-trivial enemy or completely rout a battle group.

***

### Inferno-Drinking Stance

> **Cost**: --; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisites**: None

_Sirrush swallows flame like a hungry beast, ready to roll._

Whenever you spend 1m to reload, you may draw in a nearby source of fire rather
than use your firedust. You automatically succeed on any ammunition check as
long as there is a fire within short range to consume.

**Special Activation Rules** -- You unlock this Evocation _immediately and for_
_free_ if you fail an ammunition check while fighting to uphold one of your
Intimacies, getting a free reload even if there's no fire nearby.
