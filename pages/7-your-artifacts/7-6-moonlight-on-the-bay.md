# Moonlight On the Bay

## Black Jade Reinforced Buff Jacket, Artifact 4

Many Artifacts of House Peleps attempt to trace their lineage back to the woman
herself, the Roaring Captain Astride the Currents. The Mijana family is more
successful than most.

Moonlight On the Bay was originally forged for Peleps Tondro, one of many
officers to serve aboard the _Spear of Daana'd_. Tondro was charged with mutiny
after a paranoid breakdown lead her to ignore Peleps' orders and strike out on
her own during the Battle of Shining Spear Bay. Rather than have her executed,
Peleps referred Tondro to the Empress, who elevated her as a magistrate.

Tondro's paranoia was concentrated into a sorcerous catalyst and refined into
an alloy, which laid the basis for her armor. Her powerful sense of worry would
now and forever serve her and her descendants to protect them. Her foggy mind
would clear as the fog itself bent to protect her.

The Mijana family inherited Moonlight On the Bay long ago. It once served Peleps
Clear Blue Sky in her time as a wandering hero; now that she is older and her
wandering has turned to law, she gifted the armor to her first daughter, Peleps
Tempest. It ought to help the young captain restrain herself.

## Aesthetics

Moonlight on the Bay is a single-breasted greatcoat in black and gray. Around
the waist, two panels of black jade scale protect the upper legs; elsewhere, it
is padded with inset plates of jade alloy. The dark cloth is woven through with
glistening thread-of-jade. The outermost piping is thread-of-hungry-silver.

## Evocations of Moonlight on the Bay

While attuned to Moonlight on the Bay, you never take penalties from water-based
obscurement. Thick fog and dark water do not obscure your vision. Pouring rain
and crashing waves do not stuff your ears. You suffer no penalty to move in
_watery concealment_.

Once per turn, as a reflexive action, you can clear watery obstruction nearby.
For example, you can exhale sharply to cut a pathway through thick fog, or you
can clear particulate from the water in a bubble around you. You may either
clear _all_ obscurement within close range, or a _line_ or _path_ out to short
range.

Because it is a jade artifact, you unlock Fog Soul Expression for free.

## Essence 1

### Fog Soul Expression

> **Cost**: 4m, 1wp; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Fog pours out from your armor and hands as the nascent armor awakens._

When you activate this Charm, an area out to short range from you is filled with
thick, moonlit fog. Inside the fog, it is almost impossible to see. Individuals
in the fog take a -3 penalty to visual Awareness checks and -1 to other checks
where the fog interferes.

The fogs persist until the end of the scene. Storm winds and the noonday desert
sun can disperse it as quickly as (Essence) rounds. Stunts which include how
characters chop through the fog or carve paths through it can mitigate the
penalty.

If you reactivate this Charm while the fog is still active, pay only 4m. Choose:

- **Increase**: The fogs swell out to fill another range band; first medium,
  then long, then extreme, etc. The fog cannot fill more than (higher of
  Essence or 3) total range bands.
- **Repair**: All corridors, patches, and holes in the fog are instantly
  re-filled.

### Reflection of Ill Intent

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Join Battle); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Fog Soul Expression](#fog-soul-expression)

_An eerie tingling along your spine alerts you to that which you cannot_
_yet perceive._

Reroll 6s until they fail to appear. In the very first round of battle, you may
count your Initiative as being (Essence + 3) higher in order to avoid being
caught unaware by a surprise attack.

### Misty Morning Insight

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Insant
>
> **Keywords**: Mute
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Fog Soul Expression](#fog-soul-expression)

_The fog clouds the lungs and the mind. Deceit is harder in the scrutiny of_
_the armor._

Reflexively profile your target. You cannot target someone you are currently
engaged in combat with, and you must be in an enclosed space with them.

When you activate this Evocation, fog and mist pour out from the armor for your
target to inhale. It is Mute, because it does not make your anima glow; it is
still clear that you have used some kind of magic.

## Essence 2

### Bay-Stalking Spirit

> **Cost**: 6m; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Fog Soul Expression](#fog-soul-expression)

_Within the fog, your shape is blurry and your edges unclear. You move like a_
_hint in the fog._

As long as you are in watery concealment, all enemies get -1 success to hit you.
**Withering** attacks you make against opponents in the fog get +1 Overwhelming;
**decisive** attacks you make against opponents in the fog get +1 free
commitment.

### Choking Mists Embrace

> **Cost**: 3m, 1wp; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Grapple); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Bay-Stalking Spirit](#bay-stalking-spirit)

_Peleps Tempest is a whirlpool, and under her command, the mists are eager to_
_drown._

If you succeed on your grapple roll, you may take a reflexive 5i-level
[Create an Environmental Hazard](/venture/systems/combat/gambits/#create-an-environmental-hazard)
gambit, to trap your grappled target in a dense, drowning patch of fog. He takes
damage every round he is grappled; if you release or throw him, the fog clings
and persists for the next round, rendering him incapable of moving.

### Mist Monster Method

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Fog Soul Expression](#fog-soul-expression)

_Your form looms in the fog, illuminated from behind like a terrifying beast._
_Your shape is terror._

Roll (Appearance + Presence) as an Inspire action to evoke fear and primal dread
against a set of targets who are currently in your fog. Ignore the group
influence penalty.
