# Windrose Arsenal

## Blue Jade Flying Fang Daggers, Artifact 4

Tepet Karst was an adopted daughter of Tepet himself, one of his beloved scouts.
A master of the Eastern Rose _yamabushi_ school, she was a scout and
spirit-talker of great renown. After Tepet's elevation to matriarch, Karst was
charged to chart the Blessed Isle.

In preparation for her voyage, Karst's husband forged her the Windrose Arsenal.
He cast blue jade from the stone of their home in Lord's Crossing, that no
matter where she went she would find her way home. He harvested meteor iron from
the soaring gorges of the Imperial Mountain, that no matter where she went she
would never be lost.

After several voyages and expeditionary missions on the Isle and abroad, Tepet
Karst had produced some of the most lovely maps; even today, her work is
displayed in the _yamabushi_ halls of Lord's Crossing.

Tepet surrendered the Windrose Arsenal to Cynis Fa-Len as part of the
husband-price for three Tepet husbands to marry three Cynis daughters--among
them Cynis Jaylah. Fa-Len gave Jaylah the Arsenal as her graduation gift; no
matter where Jaylah wanders, she must now constantly be reminded of her marriage
burden, and of her mother's _sincere_ and _boundless_ generosity.

## Aesthetics

The Windrose Arsenal is a beautiful necklace made from meteor iron and blue
jade. It has a large socket for a hearthstone; when there is no hearthstone, it
is an attractive asymmetric absence.

The Arsenal can summon an array of eight phantom kunai. Each knife corresponds
to one of the Eight Directions. They look as if they are made of crystal or
glass, and each one trails a unique color of light. When they strike a target,
they shatter in a cascade of ice and lightning, a flash of a trigram, and then
reappear in orbit around you a moment later.

The knives float and twist like compass arms, occasionally orientating toward
powerful elemental displays matching their direction or other powerful effects.

## Scenery Features

The Windrose Arsenal makes use of a unique mechanic called _scenery Features_. A
scenery Feature is an element of the scenery or terrain of the scene: a rushing
river, a surging gas pocket, a blazing bonfire, etc.

A Feature is defined by two traits: _scope_ and _intensity_.

When a character makes an attack which takes advantage of a Feature, their
target gets a penalty to their Defense based on the intensity of the Feature.
When a character defends in a way which takes advantage of a Feature, they get
a bonus to their Defense. Like with Intimacies, an attack or defense which takes
advantage of multiple Features only gets the _highest_ bonus or penalty.

| Intensity | Defense Penalty | Defense Bonus |
| --------: | :-------------- | :------------ |
|     Minor | -1              | +2            |
|     Major | -2              | +3            |
|  Defining | -3              | +4            |

### Scope

_Scope_ defines how large the Feature is. Scopes increase as follows:

- Personal,
- Close,
- Short,
- Medium,
- Long,
- Absolute.

_Personal_ scope affects only a single person, like a statue or a free-standing
tree. _Absolute_ scope is defined by where it is _not_ in a scene, for example,
fighting on rafts atop a rushing river.

### Intensity

Like Intimacies, a Feature has one of three Intensities: minor, major, or
defining.

A _minor_ Feature is a quirk or nuissance. Thick underbrush and the twilight
sun shining in an unfavorable direction are examples of minor Features. A minor
Feature gives +2 Defense when used to defend and -1 Defense when used as an
attack.

A _major_ Feature is felt presently and immediately over the area it affects. It
should be easy to use in a description and avoiding it feels like an effort. A
crumbling cliff face, intense cavern darkness, and a toppled feast in the middle
of a great hall are examples of major Features. A major Feature gives +3 Defense
when used to defend and -2 Defense when used to attack.

A _defining_ Feature is omnipresent in its scope and has a pressing impact on
every action. Two defining Features overlapping feels like a great struggle of
titans. Examples include a raging forest fire tearing through the scene, a
hurricane wracking a port, and the ground falling out from under your feet on an
unstable ledge whenever you move. A defining Feature gives +4 Defense when used
to defend and -3 Defense when used to attack.

## Evocations of the Windrose Arsenal

All Artifact Thrown weapons gain the following effect:

  This weapon automatically returns to you after use.

While attuned to the Arsenal, you may summon up the knives at the beginning of a
fight as a draw/ready weapon action, and can banish them at the end of the
scene. While the knives are banished, the Arsenal is still obviously magical;
you just have the nice option of not having to carry the knives around.

When summoned, the knives are oriented to their respective directions. You have
the _Direction Sense_ merit. The Arsenal counts as exceptional equipment for
making maps, navigating, or exploring new territory. If such a roll upholds a
Major or Defining Principle, double 9s.

Because you are resonant to jade, you unlock
[Erudite Cartographer Techniques](#erudite-cartographer-techniques) for free.

_The spirit of Tepet Karst is infused into the Arsenal. Simply by wielding it,_

You gain the following effects permanently:

- You know the exact route, by land or by sea, to return to where you have been;
- You can immediately understand any map you see, even if it is hidden or has
  been obscured. A map which is covered reveals as much to you as if it were
  uncovered, simply by glimpsing a corner. You gain an immediate, reflexive roll
  against ciphered maps, even if you don't know what you're looking at _is_ a
  map.
- You gain a free Lore (Maps and Cartography) specialty. You may apply your
  Survival specialties as if they were Lore specialties to Introduce Fact or
  Contest Fact.

_new sights. It empowers you to find the unknown._

Pick one:

- **Directions:** Pick a destination whose name you know but whose location you
- don't, such as a town or valley. The Arsenal points the way relative to your
- current location.
- **Discovery:** The Arsenal points toward _some_ nearby unknown place of
- significance or power, like a wayward demesne or a set of ruins.

Once per travel, when you activate this Charm, you get a banked point of
Willpower, which you can use on any Ride, Sail, or Survival roll to move toward
your goal, or on any Lore roll to introduce fact about it. You can also spend
the Willpower to help someone else's roll who is doing the journeying for you,
like assist the captain of a ship.

_Through the power of the Arsenal, you either create a new feature in a surge_
_of elemental power, or take advantage of a feature which was always present in_
_the scene, we players just hadn't noticed it..._

Roll (Intelligence + Lore) with your Maps and Cartography background as an
_Introduce Scenery_ roll. An _Introduce Scenery_ roll creates or reveals a
personal, minor Feature within the scene. Each success on your roll gives you
one point, which you can spend to enhance the Feature:

- **1 point**: Increase the scope of the Feature by one step;
- **2 points**: Increase the intensity of the Feature by one step.

Unspent points are lost.

If you introduce a Feature which is also an Environmental Hazard, you must pay
Initiative as if you had used the
[Create an Environnmental Hazard](/venture/systems/combat/gambits/#create-an-environmental-hazard)
gambit.

roll.
