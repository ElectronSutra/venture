# Charms

A _Charm_ is a system abstraction for the instinctual ability of all Princes of
the Earth to channel their Essence into cool flashy effects. Most Charms do not
exist within the fiction; there are no books of their techniques, but someone
may point at you and say, "Ah, the ancient breath technique of Master Daanxi!"

Most of your magic in _Exalted_ is represented by Charms.

## How to Read a Charm

A Charm is listed with many little bits of detail bundled together. Here is a
guide on how to read them.

### Cost

Every Charm has a listed cost. The cost might be --, in which case the Charm is
permanent or free. Costs are abbreviated as follows:

| Abbreviation | Meaning                              |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- |
| #m           | # motes                              |
| #wp          | # Willpower                          |
| #ahl         | # aggravated health levels of damage |
| #bhl         | # bashing health levels of damage    |
| #lhl         | # lethal health levels of damage     |
| #a           | # levels of glow from your anima     |
| #i           | # Initiative                         |

### Minimums

You must meet both of these minimums in order to purchase this Charm.

### Charm Types

Charms have four types: Simple, Reflexive, Supplemental, and Permanent.

#### Simple

A simple Charm creates an action. You cannot flurry a simple Charm unless it
explicitly says that you can.

#### Reflexive

A reflexive Charm can be used at any time, whether or not it is your turn.

#### Supplemental

A supplemental Charm enhances a given action. Supplemental Charms can only
be used for actions using the Ability (Melee Charms to supplement a Melee roll,
etc.) unless the Charm explicitly says otherwise. A supplemental Charm will
specify in parentheses what specific action or actions it affects.

#### Permanent

A permanent Charm is always available.

### Keywords

Charm [keywords](/venture/charms/keywords) encode fiddly bits of information
into abstract keywords, like how keywords work in _Magic: the Gathering_. They
just make a particular noteworthy bit of information easier to notate.

### Duration

Most Charms are _instant_, meaning that they happen at the moment that the cost
is spent.

If a Charm has a cost that lasts longer than 1 turn, the cost must be
_committed_. While they are committed, you do not regenerate them.

Lifting a commitment is reflexive and ends the effect immediately.

### Prerequisite Charms

You must meet _all_ listed prerequisites in order to purchase a Charm.

## Charm Limits

Many Charms add bonus dice or successes. Note the following restriction:

    You may only add up to (Ability + Specialty) dice using Charms to a single
    action.

Automatic successes count as 2 dice.

This is called your **Charm limit**. Your Charm limit counts not only your
Excellency, but _all dice added from all active Charm effects_.

Anything called out as "non-Charm" does not count against your Charm limit
