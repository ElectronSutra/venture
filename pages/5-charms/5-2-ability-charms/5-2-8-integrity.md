gain (Essence) Initiative for each Willpower you spend.

_bell. The bonds of the Dragon's Blood are stronger than any others -- and you_
_are called to serve together._

Whenever you see another Dragon-Blood in danger, you may activate this Charm.
You immediately gain a Tie of loyalty and protection toward him, or if you
already have one, you may strenghten it one step instantly. For the rest of the

swear an oath to assist him. You add (Intimacy) non-Charm bonus dice to the
first Join Battle or influence roll you make while pursuing this oath.
