>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You are a master of many Artifacts; your Essence permeates them. Your arsenal_
_is a part of you, and you a part of it._

Commit the full-cost attunement of an Artifact weapon. Reduce the attunement
cost of further Artifact weapons to 1m each. This doesn't stack with any other
discount. If you end your full-cost attunement for any reason, you must commit
motes to one of your remaining weapons sufficient to bring it to the full
commitment.

>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

You may banish any attuned jade armor into a display of an element. It melts
into a waterfall, flies away as smoke as you walk through a bonfire, or fades
into a stone pillar, that sort of thing.

You can use this Charm again to withdraw it from any manifestation of the same
element. You don it immediately with a cool enough stunt.

Your anima always counts as an "appropriate elemental display" for your Aspect's
element.

This Charm can be purchased as a Favored Charm.

### Dragon-Graced Raiment

> **Cost**: -- (4m); **Mins**: Resistance 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene _or_ Indefinite
>
> **Keywords**: None
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Elemental Aegis](#elemental-aegis)

_You infuse your armor with the elements, or shape it from them._

When you recall armor banished with Elemental Aegis, you can put it on in just
(Mobility Penalty + 1) rounds. It is wreathed in the element you used to summon
it: its plates are frozen lightning, its elegant layers are woven from colorful
flame, its chestplate is wood and the epaulettes huge blossoms, etc. It remains
empowered for 1 scene.

You can also use Elemental Aegis to create any type of mundane armor instantly
out of the elements. Created armor normally disappears when the scene ends, but
you can commit 4m to make it indefinite. You may also create mundane clothes
that count as exceptional equipment for all social rolls that take your clothes
into account (esp. through a stunt).

Each element conveys the following benefits when girding or shaping armor:

- **AIR**. The armor is weightless. It gains the Buoyant and Silent tags. Its
  mobility penalty is reduced by 1 when it impacts your Evasion. Light armor
  adds 1 bonus die to Stealth rolls.
- **EARTH**. The armor gains +1 Soak, or +(higher of Essence or 3) soak against
  smashing attacks or any other attack that would attempt to move you. Artifact
  armor gets +1 Hardness against such attacks, and normal clothing gets Hardness
  4 against them. Earth clothing does not count as armor but offers Soak and
  Hardness against smashing attacks.
- **FIRE**. Fire armor deals 1 die of **lethal** damage, ignoring Hardness, to
  any enemy who hits you with an unarmed or natural attack, or once per round to
  anyone who attempts to grab you. You get an automatic success on all
  Apperance-based threaten rolls.
- **WATER**. Water armor gets the Concealable tag and adds 1 automatic success
  to resist being grappled, bound, restrained, or to move through tight spaces.
  Armor that is already Concealable gains an automatic success on disguise
  rolls, as does water clothing.
- **WOOD**. Wood armor grants 1 automatic success on Inspire rolls, Instill
  rolls to create ties of attraction to the wearer, and persuade or bargain
  rolls to seduce characters. Likewise wood clothing.

This Charm can be purchased as a Favored Charm.
