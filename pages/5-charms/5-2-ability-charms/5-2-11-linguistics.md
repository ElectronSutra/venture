# Linguistics Charms

## Excellency

### Lightning Quill Mastery

> **Cost**: 2m/success; **Mins**: Linguistics 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air, Balanced, Excellency
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your words fly through the air and across the page like leaves on the wid._

Add 1 automatic success per 2m spent.

You may reroll 1 failed die for every 10 you roll, including if you reroll and
get a 10.

## Essence 1

### Cryptic Essence Cipher

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Linguistics 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water, Written-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your words slip away, always slightly out of sight from their true meaning --_
_except for those in the know._

Name a recipient of your message. Then roll ([Manipulation or Intelligence] +
Linguistics) to encode the message.

The recipient can read the message just fine -- the words rearrange themselves
on the page to become a clear message. To anyone else, it is nonsense. To
decipher the message, they must roll ([Perception or Intelligence ] +
Linguistics) and get more successes than you got on the encoding roll.

Instead of a recipient, you may choose to make the message clear to anyone who
shares a specified Intimacy with you.

### Signature-Stealing Calligraphy

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Linguistics 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water, Written-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your calligraphy flows like water in a river, beautiful and mysterious, before_
_it settles into someone else's hand._

Roll (Manipulation + Linguistics). If you succeed, you manage to perfectly
replicate someone else's hand. To do so, you must have read at least three
samples of their handwriting. A reader may roll (Perception + Linguistics) to
determine that the writing is fraudulent.

If you want to include written social influence, you may choose to use the
fraud roll as your social roll, or roll a different one. Anyone who knows your
writing is fraudulent gets +2 Resolve to resist this influence.

### Fervor-Inciting Brushstrokes

> **Cost**: 3m, 1wp; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Inspire); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Written-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your words spark fires in the hearts of your readers._

Double 9s. You must inspire a strong emotion -- fear, lust, anger, etc.

If you restrict your influence to target a single person, they must enter a
decision point and call on a Major or Defining Intimacy in order to resist it.

### Tenacious Dragon Scholar

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Earth
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Earth does not move for simple words._

Gain +1 Resolve against any written influence. You may use Linguistics in place
of Integrity to calculate your Resolve.

### Wind-Carried Words Technique

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Linguistics 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You speak to the wind, and the wind speaks for you._

You may send a message of no more than a few sentences to any target within
(Essence) miles. No one but your intended target can overhear it. The difficulty
to overhear it with magic is (your Essence + Linguistics).

The range of this Charm increases as your Essence increases.

### Rose's Secret Petal

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Cryptic Essence Cipher](#cryptic-essence-cipher),
> [Wind-Carried Words Technique](#wind-carried-words-technique)

_Secrets grow like scattered petals._

You plant a written message into the soil. Influenced by your Wood Essence, it
rapidly grows into a small, colorful flower. The arrangement of petals, leaves,
and colors acts like a cipher created using Cryptic Essence Cipher. The message
it conveys can be up to one page long.

Roll ([Intelligence or Manipulation] + Linguistics) with double 9s to determine
the strength of the cipher. In order to crack the cipher, someone must first
determine that the flower _is_ a message to begin with. Only magical
examination reveals the true nature of the blossom.

The meaning of the flower is immediately recognizable to the intended recipient.

### Language-Learning Ritual

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Air is the medium of speech, and all words are clear._

You may understand any language that you have been exposed to for at least
(1 - Essence) hours. You do not speak it, only understand it.

**ENHANCEMENT** (Linguistics 4, Essence 2) -- You may speak and write in the
language. You have a noticeable accent and your writing is unsubtle. You take
-3 on social influence.

### Root Tongue of the Dragon's Stemmata

> **Cost**: 3m, 1wp; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Wood
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Language-Learning Ritual](#language-learning-ritual)

_Flavor._

Your spoken language can be understood by any other Dragon-Blooded, and you can
understand all of their words, regardless of what language you or they are
speaking. You can read anything written in any language by another Prince of the
Earth while this Charm is active, but they can't read your writing unless they
are normally able to.

While this Charm is active, you reroll 1s on Read Intentions against other
Dragon-Blooded and to break ciphers.

## Essence 2

### Enigma-Reading Eye

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Cryptic Essence Cipher](#cryptic-essence-cipher)

_The lightning flash of your eyes cuts through codes and ciphers._

Roll ([Perception or Intelligence] + Linguistics) with double 9s to break a
code or decipher a hidden message. This includes subtext as well as explicitly
hidden messages.

### Thousand Tongues Meditation

> **Cost**: -- (+5m, 1wp); **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Permanent; **Duration**: Permanent
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Language-Learning Ritual](#language-learning-ritual)

_Language is a tool and you are an adept user._

When you use Language-Learning Ritual, you may pay 5m, 1wp to waive the
requirement of previous exposure. You can speak it instantly even without
having been exposed to it.

***

### Shared Breath Understanding

> **Cost**: 5m, 1wp; **Mins**: Linguistics 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Varies
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Thousand Tongues Meditation](#thousand-tongues-meditation)

_The breath is an expression of the self. It is clay in your hands..._

Roll ([Manipulation or Wits] + Linguistics) against the Resolve of a target
within close range. If you succeed, you steal his voice.

You gain fluency in a single language that your target speaks, as if under the
benefits of [Language-Learning Ritual](#language-learning-ritual), for the next
(Essence + extra successes) days. You suffer no penalties for using that
language and can mimic the voice of your target perfectly.

Your target's voice is suppressed for the duration of this Charm. He can only
whisper and takes -3 on all spoken social interaction. He can reclaim his voice
from you by closing to close range and succeeding on a difficulty 6 roll (a
gambit in combat), by stealing it from you using Larceny, or other appropriate
means.

### Voices on the Wind

> **Cost**: 3m, 1wp; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Wind-Carried Words Technique](#wind-carried-words-technique)

_The wind carries voices far and wide -- and right to your ears._

You add (Linguistics / 2, round up) to all eavesdropping rolls. If you Read
Intentions while eavesdropping, your target gets -2 Guile if they do not know
you are listening in.

***

### Speech Without Words

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Linguistics 3, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Air
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Wind-Carried Words Technique](#wind-carried-words-technique)

_The subtle Essence of Air mediates your communication. You do not need to_
_speak for your meaning to be clear._

Designate all of your Sworn Kin and up to (Essence) other characters as
recipients. You can communicate with one another using visual signals like hand
signs, body language, and facial expressions. Only short, simple sentences can
be conveyed, but they are conveyed perfectly.

Observers do not casually notice the communication. An observer specifically
looking for communication may roll (Perception + Awareness) to notice, but not
understand, the communication.

***

### Caustic Wit Invective

> **Cost**: 1m, 1wp; **Mins**: Linguistics 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Water, Written-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Fervor-Inducing Brushstrokes](#fervor-inciting-brushstrokes)

_Your scorn burns like acid._

Roll to write a mocking message or a satire that conveys an Instill to erode a
specific Principle or positive Tie. This message is _so_ caustic that even a
diehard believer takes pause. No one subject to the influence can use the
targeted Intimacy to boost their Resolve against the effect.
