# Presence Charms

## Excellency

### Glowing Coal Radiance

> **Cost**: 2m/success; **Mins**: Presence 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Excellency, Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your presence is a burning coal searing into the minds of those around you._

Add 1 automatic success per 2m spent.

Every 10 you roll lets you roll an additional non-Charm bonus die.

## Essence 1

### Eternally Argumentative Flame

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Presence 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One turn
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your sword and your words are twin fuel for your fire._

When you flurry a Presence or Socialize social action with another action in
combat, the flurry penalty is just -1 on each action instead of -3. You don't
suffer any defense penalty for flurrying.

**FIRE AURA** -- Ignore the penalty entirely.

***

### Unbearable Taunt Technique

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Presence 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your words are burning cinders, just daring your foe to retort._

Inspire a single target with anger. If successful, your target immediately
responds with hostility -- threats, storming outrage, or the start of combat.

If you use this action in combat, your target must attack you on his next turn
unless he pays Willpower to resist the Inspire. Even if he does, he still loses
2i if he attacks someone other than you.

### Burning Dragon Mien

> **Cost**: 4m; **Mins**: Presence 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_You light up with burning Fire Essence, towering as a colossus of smoke and_
_fire._

Threaten a target and get double 9s. If you beat their Resolve you steal 1i,
even if they spend 1wp to resist the influence.

***

### Warm-Faced Seduction Style

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Presence 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your eyes glow with suggestions of subtle things, your hair catches the light_
_just so... and hearts melt in the presence of your warm and charming glow._

Roll to seduce a single target as a Persuade action. If you beat his Resolve, he
_also_ develops a Minor Tie of lust toward you unless he resists it with
Willpower.

**FIRE AURA** -- Add 1 non-Charm success for every point your Appearance exceeds
that of the target, up to (Essence) times.

## Essence 2

### Debate-Sparking Bonfire

>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Unbearable Taunt Technique](#unbearable-taunt-technique)

_A stray word becomes a spark that lights the powder keg._

Roll to Inspire one or more targets with anger. You ignore the multitarget
penalty.

Anyone who is affected by this Inspire is required to express their outrage at
you. They might start arguing with you, start spreading rumors about you, say
something hurtful, or draw their sword.

>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Burning Dragon Mien](#burning-dragon-mien),

> [Warm-Faced Seduction Style](#warm-faced-seduction-style)

_Rivers carve canyons and shape landscapes; the tides wear away stone. So, too,_
_can you cause change in others._

Target a single character in the grip of intense emotions (either Inspired or
simply RPing them) and Inspire them with (Manipulatin + Presence). If you
succeed, they stop feeling their current emotion and start feeling the one you
Inspired instead.

To resist this new emotion, the target must enter a Decision Point and call on
a Major or Defining Intimacy.

### Fearsome Dragon Presence

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Presence 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: One tick
>
> **Keywords**: Fire, Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Burning Dragon Mien](#burning-dragon-mien)

_Your dragon energy is too strong for your foes to handle._

Any attack rolls, social influence rolls, or rushes against you this tick take a
-2 penalty. If an enemy spends 1wp to resist, they are immune for the rest of
the scene.

**FIRE AURA** -- They take a -(Essence) penalty instead.

***

### Moth to the Candle

> **Cost**: 2m, 1wp; **Mins**: Presence 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Fire
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Unbearable Taunt Technique](#unbearable-taunt-technique)

_Your light is a candle, and your foes merely moths._

Enemies in the fight must prioritize you over your allies. They can spend 1wp to
resist this for the rest of the scene.

For the rest of the scene, Unbearable Taunt Technique only costs 1m. If you
successfully taunt an enemy who hasn't spend the 1wp to resist this Charm, he
must use his next action to close in and give you a good thwappin', if possible.

***

### Grinding Millstone Argument

> **Cost**: 3m, 1wp; **Mins**: Presence 5, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Earth, Restriction (1/scene)
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Eternally Argumentative Flame](#eternally-argumentative-flame)

_Flavor._

After you fail a Persuade roll, you may immediately try again without any
penalty. If they use the same Intimacy to boost their Resolve as they did the
first time, then the bonus is reduced by 1 point.
