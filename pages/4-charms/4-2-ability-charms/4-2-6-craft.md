## Excellency

### Masterful Dragon-Artisan Expertise

> **Cost**: 1m/die; **Mins**: Craft 1, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Any roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Earth, Excellency
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_All materials yield beneath the skillfull hands of a true artisan._

Add 1 die per 1m spent.

If the roll you are enhancing was rewarded a sunt, you get 1sxp as long as you
spend at least 1m on this Excellency.

## Essence 1

### Stone-Carving Fingers

> **Cost**: 6m; **Mins**: Craft 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Basic or Major Craft roll); **Duration**: One project
>
> **Keywords**: Balanced, Earth
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_Your fingers are infused with Earth Essence, and your very touch makes stone_
_supple and pliable._

You may undertake a basic or major Craft project without any need for tools, as
long as your material is stone or earth (not metal!).

If you have tools, you work (Essence + 1) times faster. No matter how fast you
work, it always takes you at least 1 minute to finish.

### Flaw-Finding Examination

> **Cost**: 1m, 1wp; **Mins**: Craft 3, Essence 1

_With a quick blow, flaws and errors, no matter how fine, become obvious to_
_your trained craftsman's eye._

Roll (Perception + Craft) to start a basic or major repair project or start a
feat of demolition. You multiply your rate of work by your successes; so four
successes means you work four times faster. This is cumulative with
Stone-Carving Fingers.

You gain a Craft or Athletics specialty related to the project; if you already
have such a specialty, you may instead gain one non-Charm automatic success. You
may add this Specialty to your Strength to determine which feats of demolition
you may attempt.

_Skillful hands make even tricky materials bend beneath your will._

You may use Stone-Carving Fingers to manipulate the raw materials of any Craft
that you have at least 4 dots in. This Charm takes on an element based on the
nature of the project.

You cannot use this Charm for Artifacts or large-scale construction.

results from Flaw-Finding Examination.

_Knowing how to break something is easy once you know how it's put together._

above that which is neede for the feat are added as non-Charm dice to the roll.

a 10 gives you 1gxp instead.
