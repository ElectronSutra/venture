_and need you to be._

toward another character who exists in their society or social group; or,

Resolve against this roll.

_Intoxicants are the great lubricator of social friction._

This Charm can only be used while you are serving intoxicants. It makes them
all-around better: wines become sweeter, tobacco more full, etc.

Each character who partakes gets -1 Guile and is treated as though they have a
positive Minor Tie toward each of their fellow partygoers.

If anyone botches a social roll in front of the inebriated, the party turns
against them. Each of the characters affected by this Charm loses their positive
Minor Tie toward the botcher and gets a negative one instead

Regardless, this effect disappears once they sober up.

_imperfections of the world._

You may use this Charm after you spend at least one hour bathing. For the
duration of this Charm, you and your clothes cannot be stained or dirtied by any
mundane material.

Any character you interact with is treated as having a positive Minor Tie toward
you, the context of which you can specify per-character. If you interact with a
character that already has a positive Tie toward you, they get -1 Resolve
instead. Any affected character may spend 1wp to become immune to this Charm. If
you offend someone or treat them demandingly, the magic instantly breaks for
them.

_Those who believe fire is always apparent forget the lessons of Hesiesh. Fire_
_can be subtle as well; or fire can lie._

Get +1 Guile when another character makes a Read Intentions roll.

If he fails, he doesn't realize it. Instead, he believes he's succeeded, but
gains incorrect information. He perceives an exaggerated version of you, either
exaggerating your current emotions or the context of one of your Intimacies. You
choose the emotion and how it is exaggerated.

For example, he may perceive your boredom as a soul-crushing ennui that plagues
your every moment; your interest in a pretty face as a love worthy of a ballad;
your distaste for a faux pas as the intimations of a hateful lifelong vendetta
against the person.

**FIRE AURA** -- The +1 Guile doesn't count as a Charm bonus.
