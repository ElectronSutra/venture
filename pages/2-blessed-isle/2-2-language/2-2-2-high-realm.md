# High Realm

High Realm is the common language of the nobility and the official language of
all affairs of government within the Realm. Although it is best known as the
language of the Dynasty, High Realm is spoken natively by both Dynasts and
patricians. You can find someone who speaks High Realm anywhere that there is an
official presence of the government.

## Characteristics of High Realm

High Realm is more or less an archetypal Northern Wànzi language, displaying all
of the characteristics that make them distinct. All Dynasts and patricians are
raised speaking High Realm, sometimes alongside the local languages. High Realm
is a beautiful and elegant language with many nuances.

High Realm has four tones and two lengths, long and short. It displays a strong
system of what is known as _tone sandhi_, where the exact tone of a syllable
depends not only on its root meaning, but also on the adjacent tones. For
example, a peaking tone before another peaking tone becomes a rising tone; _kâ_
plus _pâ_ becomes _ká pâ_. This can often make one word homophonous to another,
even though it is understood correctly by the listener. This ambiguity is the
basis for many poetic forms and jokes.

    One example of such a joke is,
        Q: What is more valuable than silver?
        A: Pigs.
    This joke relies on the fact that sandhi makes the word for "jade" sound
    the same as the word for "pig" in the sentence "Jade is more valuable than
    silver."

The permitted finals are _m_, _n_, _r_, and _l_; the final _n_ is pronounced as
a velar nasal, _ng_. Final _r_ is rolled, but intermediary _r_ is a tap. The
vowels _i_ and _ii_ are always pronounced in full; they are never reduced, as
they would be in some other Northern Wànzi languages.

High Realm uses an SOV word order, which is usually considered archaic in other
Northern Wànzi languages. High Realm has a past and a non-past tense, as well as
the usual system of moods and aspects. Adjectives are not a distinct category
from nouns; a standalone adjective is a noun meaning, "a thing which is X".

## Status of High Realm

High Realm is the premier language of Creation; to be a noble is to speak High
Realm. Indeed, the language and the status as noble class are deeply, deeply
intertwined with one another. No noble can function who does not speak High
Realm; no individual who speaks High Realm can truly be considered common.

High Realm is the language of the Classics, the language of the Empress, and the
language of refined and educated society. High Realm is a vocal poem in every
utterance; the speaker weaves a tapestry with every word she speaks. The other
languages of the Isle are trivial things compared to it.

## Writing High Realm

High Realm is written in a _syllabic_ script, a beautiful calligraphy. Every
symbol represents a complete syllable. Final consonants are written as a full
syllable, and require the reader to simply know that the vowel is silent.

High Realm is also used to render foreign names, so sometimes the syllabic
nature is not as perfect. In these cases, it is customary to represent an
unusual cluster by writing two syllables connected together: the offstroke of
one syllable mark flows into the next, leaving the first vowel unpronounced.

High Realm is written in columns, from left to right. Joining symbols to make a
cluster places two characters horizontally adjacent on a single row.

## Making a High Realm Name

High Realm names are expected for the nobility. Many lost eggs adopt a High
Realm name as soon as they are brought in to the noble class. Patricians are
named in High Realm as well, and satrapial monarchs often adopt both a name in
their native language and a name in High Realm. Successful merchants and
craftsmen work under a High Realm name.

### The Sounds

High Realm makes use of the following sounds. For the purposes of creating a
name, you should **ignore tones completely**. They are a flavorful element, not
a restrictive one, when it comes to making names.

High Realm distinguishes aspirated from unaspirated, and does not distinguish
voicing. For consonants, you have the following symbols; they are all read more
or less like they are in contemporary Mandarin Chinese: _b_, _p_, _d_, _t_, _g_,
_k_, _z_, _c_, _zh_, _ch_, _j_, _q_, _f_, _s_, _sh_, _x_, _h_, _w_, _l_, and
_y_. You also have an _r_. It is usually rolled but you definitely can just make
a regular _r_ sound. It does not sound like a Mandarin _r_.

For vowels, you have the basic _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, and _u_, as well as their
long forms: _aa_, _ee_, _ii_, _oo_, _uu_.

### The Shape

A name in High Realm is going to be one or a couple syllables. In general, you
can pair any starting consonant with any vowel and get a valid syllable. You can
also end a syllable with _m_, _ng_, _r_, or _l_; I wouldn't recommend doing that
if your vowel is long, I think it looks kind of ugly.

Other than those pieces of advice, I'd say just pick a pattern like C-V-C-V or
C-V-C-V-C and some sounds that all go nicely together. There you have it, a
completely aesthetically-consistent High Realm name.
