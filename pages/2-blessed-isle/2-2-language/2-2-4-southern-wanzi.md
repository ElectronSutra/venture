# Southern Wànzi Languages

The Southern Wànzi languages are a family of languages that can be found in the
southern and central reaches of the eastern half of the Blessed Isle. The
Southern Wànzi spectrum encompasses the Dragonswrath desert, the Mhaltin and
Dhorash mountains, and proceeds upward to its northern border with the Northern
Wànzi family in the Imperial River valleys.

_Wànzi_ means "from the Wàn" in High Realm. The languages are so named because
of their similarity to Wàn, the Xianyu language which the Empress spoke before
she took the throne. In the modern Isle, more people speak a Wànzi language --
northern or southern -- than any other language family. Between the two, the
Southern Wànzi languages are by far the more removed from High Realm, but can
still trace their vocabulary and grammar back to a closer common ancestor with
the Northern Wànzi than any other family.

## Characteristics of the Southern Wànzi Languages

One characteristic of the Wànzi languages, both Northern and Southern, is the
compelte atbsence of phonemic voicing. Where the old languages of the Isle often
had multiple layers of distinction in their stops, the Southern Wànzi languages
only have two: aspirated (with a puff of air) or unaspirated (without it).

The most obvious difference between the Southern and Northern Wànzi languages is
that the Southern family is much more permissive with final consonants. Where
the Northern Wànzi languages only really usually allow a final _-n_, the
Southern Wànzi languages allow a much greater range of finals: usually some or
all of _-m_, _-n_, _-ng_, _-r_, _-p_, _-t_, and _-k_. The Southern languages
also often lose the distinction between _r_ and _l_ in most positions, reducing
both to _r_.

Vowels are where the Southern Wànzi langauges most stand out. First, many of
them feature the vowel _ue_ and some _oe_, which expands their total inventory.
Second, the Southern Wàn languages have among the largest tonal inventories not
only in the Isle, but in the world. A real standout here is the Paishek language
spoken in and around Vane Prefecture; some scholars claim that Paishek has as
many as 11 distinct tones, although such analyses are disputed. Most Southern
Wànzi languages have roughly six or seven tones. The consonants _m_, _n_, and
_ng_ can stand alone as syllables; the sentence "_m’ ’ng m’ ’n_" is a famous
example of a valid phrase in Pagodi meaning "to dance about nervously."

Grammatically, the Southern Wànzi languages mostly share the Northern Wànzi
language's distinguishing traits: lack of clitic usage, strict word order, and
a dominant SOV word order. The Northern and Southern Wànzi languages are
startlingly similar in grammar -- often, you can substitute words almost
one-for-one and get a valid sentence. Because of this similarity, scholars
consider the Northern and Southern Wànzi languages _very_ closely related
families, despite their divergent sounds.

## Status of the Southern Wànzi Languages

The Southern Wànzi languages are stereotypically lower class. The land that they
cover is expansive, but generally of little use -- deserts, hills, and areas
with little impactful economic output. As a result, the people who speak
Southern Wànzi languages are generally poor peasantry and inconspicuous
patricians. In a play, a farmer character or backwoods hick probably has a
strong accent reminiscent of the Southern Wànzi family.

Despite this class connotation, the Southern Wànzi languages are also thought to
be _reliable_ to a certian extent. The Southern Wànzi folk are simple: they work
hard, they do what they say they will do, and they are generally honest and
friendly, if crass and uneducated.

## Accent Features of Southern Wànzi Languages

If you want your character to have a Southern Wànzi accent, you might mention
some of the following vocal habits:

- You don't fully pronounce your _i_ sounds, especially at the front of the
  mouth; they become a sort of buzz; "sze" instead of "si".
- You have a habit to reduce syllables like "ma" and "na" to "m’" and "’n";
- You pronounce _f_ like _w_.
- You use a lot of very expressive tones that aren't quite standard.

Encountering a Dynast with a Southern Wànzi accent would be unusual, because it
is a backwater accent. House Nellens and House Ragara have a reasonable number
of scions who sound kind of Southern, owing to their holdings in the area;
[Ragara Sayyah](/venture/game-record/dramatis-personae/#ragara-sayyah) has a
Southern Wànzi accent.

## Making a Southern Wànzi Name

Southern Wànzi names are distinct for their final consonants and the presence of
more than just the five basic vowels.

### The Sounds

For a stereotypical Southern Wànzi name, you should use some of the following
symbols: _p_, _p’_, _t_, _t’_, _k_, _k’_, _ts_, _ts’_, _ch_, _ch’_, _m_, _n_,
_ng_, _s_, _hs_, _h_, _w_, _r_, and _y_. _Hs_ is pronounced like "sh", but is
spelled like that because Wade-Giles are crazy?

You have the vowels _i_, _e_, _a_, _u_, and _o_, as well as _eu_ (ü in German)
and _eo_ (ö in German). If you want to _really_ make it look Southern Wànzi, you
can use the following spellings everywhere:

    tsi -> tzu,
    ts’i -> tz’u,
    chi -> cze,
    ch’i -> cz’e,
    si -> sze.

This represents the "buzz" that Southern Wànzi speakers often have (the same
phenomenon as contemporary Mandarin).

### The Shape

You can have any consonant at the start of the syllable, and any vowel that you
like. At the end of the syllable, you can have _m_, _n_, _ng_, _p_, _t_, or _k_.

Two syllables sounds like a good flow.
