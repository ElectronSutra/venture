# Proto-Isle

> Because Proto-Isle isn't fully understood by the Realm, **this section is**
> **written objectively**.

Proto-Isle is the common ancestor of the Isle's many languages today. Proto-Isle
is most useful to our lore concerns as a source of many of of the common
patterns and elements that can be found spread across the contemporary Isle
languages.

## Phonology

Proto-Realm had a robust consonantal phonology which has mostly been reduced
over time in its descendants; some families are more conservative than others in
this regard. One major point of distinction was in the stop series, which had
four major variations per point of articulation: plain («p»), voiceless
aspirated («ph»), voiced («b»), and voiced aspirated («bh»). Proto-Isle also
distinguished five major points of articulation: labial, dento-alveolar,
retroflex, palatal, and velar. Proto-Realm also featured a phonemic glottal stop
(’) and two rhotics, a dental and a retroflex.

For vowels, Proto-Isle had a straightforward and typical five-vowel inventory.
The complexity of Proto-Isle's vocal phonology is mostly related to tone and
length distinctions. Proto-Isle had several phonetic tones, much like Chinese.
It also featured a long/short distinction.

Proto-Isle syllables tended to be relatively simple constructions. The most
complicated structures are (C)V((C)C) syllables, in which the first consonant of
the coda must be a liquid.

## Morphology

Proto-Isle was mostly isolating, with complicated syntactical rules governing
the placement of words relative to one another. An extensive system of
argument-function clitics theoretically allowed for great word order variation,
but most Proto-Isle tended to SOV or SVO orders.

## Writing

Proto-Isle was not a written language. Some truly ancient divinities and old
heavenly archives have depictions of Proto-Isle written using the Old Realm
script; these writings are inconsistent, each transcriber seemingly developing
their own system to represent the Proto-Isle sound. In the end, it was a spoken
language, and no real record of it remains.

Future linguists in Creation may eventually reconstruct it similarly to how
contemporary real-world linguists have reconstructed Proto-Indo-European.
