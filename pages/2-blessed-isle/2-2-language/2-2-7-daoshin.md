# Daoshin Languages

The Daoshin languages are the family of languages which can mostly be found on
the southwestern Daoshin Peninsula and among the trailing islands. It is spoken
throughout the peninsula, up to the border regions with the Plains of Rusted
Iron where it blends with Arjufi, as well as throughout the Pendant Isles and
many of the southwestern island chains.

The prestige language of the Daoshin Languages is quite clearly Myioni, the
dominant language of the city of Myion. The Myioni language is the unofficial
language of Cathak's legions, as the majority of the House's soldiers hail from
the Daoshin Peninsula. Many Daoshin languages feature borrowings from the
Flametongue languages and from the neighboring Arjufi and Ru language families.

## Characteristics of the Daoshin Languages

The Daoshin languages do not distinguish aspiration and function mostly on a
voicing distinction. This is a common trait of Western Isle languages, shared
with the Ru languages to the north and the Arjufi languages to the east. Many
Daoshin languages have a broad/slender consonant distinction which outsiders
find baffling.

The Daoshin languages usually have a straightforward consonant system, and many
have a distinct feature of _approximant reduction_. The usual Daoshin _r_ is a
throaty fricative sound, and the _l_ is likewise transformed into a kind of
lateral fricative. These two sounds are not generally found in the rest of the
Isle. Many Daoshin languages, especially at the far west of the peninsula, have
the _th_ sound like some Arjufi languages.

Many Daoshin languages have a large number of vowels because of a system called
_vowel harmony_. No documented Daoshin language has phonemic tone. In a given
word, all vowels must be _rounded_ vowels or _unrounded_ vowels; the vowel _ə_
is neutral and can go anywhere.

Grammatically, the Daoshin languages show some of the most complicated
morphology of the Isle's languages. They are highly fusional, and make use of a
full series of declensions and conjugations which are derived from clitics and
short words in Old Realm. The grammar of these languages has very little
resemblance to the one-word-per-word rule of the Eastern Isle's languages.

## Status of Daoshin Languages

The Daoshin languages are particularly associated with mercantilism and trade;
they sound like money, but not in a respectable upper-crust way as much as in a
tense-negotiations-over-the-table way. They also sound like army speak,
especially because of their prominent use in the Cathak legions. In general they
have a slightly imposing air -- a Daoshin speaker is either after your wallet or
your land.

## Accent Features of the Daoshin Languages

If you want your character to have a Daoshin accent, you might mention some of
the following vocal features:

- You might carry over some of your harmony rules into High Realm, pronouncing
  your _u_ and _o_ as kind of flat when they are surrounded by _i_ and _e_
  syllables, or _i_ and _e_ as kind of round when surrounded by _u_ and _o_
  syllables.
- You insert a _y_ between consonants and _i_, like _kyi_ instead of _ki_ or
  _myi_ instead of _mi_.
- You might use a sort of French-like _r_ sound instead of a proper _r_.
- Your _f_ becomes an _h_ in front of _u_ and _o_.

The Daoshin peninsula is a hub for trade with the west and southwest, so you can
find plenty of Dynasts with Daoshin accents -- House Cathak, of course, but also
Peleps, Ragara, and anyone who has a stake in the trade. Lots of legionary
veterans borrow Daoshin words to describe complicated formations, based on
General Cathak's writings and commentaries.

## Making a Daoshin Name

Daoshin names almost all end with consonants.

### The Sounds

The Daoshin languages are complicated. You should use the following consonants:
_p_, _py_, _b_, _by_, _t_, _ty_, _d_, _dy_, _k_, _ky_, _g_, _gy_, _m_, _my_,
_n_, _ny_, _th_, _dh_, _s_, _z_, _sh_, _j_, _kh_, _gh_, _h_, _r_, and _l_. The
Daoshin inventory is slightly larger because of the _-y-_ sounds; these are
actual separate consonants in a lot of Daoshin languages. _Dh_ is like _th_ in
_there_; _th_ like _th_ in _thin_. _J_ as in French or Turkish.

For vowels, you can use the following: _i_, _ü_, _e_, _ö_, _y_, _u_, _o_, _a_.
If you don't care, you can use them in any combination and just ignore the
harmony rules; if you actually care about the harmony rules, pick one of the
following two groups and only use vowels from within that single group:

|         |   Vowels   |
| ------: | :--------: |
|   Round | ü, ö, u, o |
| Unround | i, e, y, a |

One easy rule is just use the same vowel twice -- plus, that sounds pretty nice
a lot of the time.

### The Shape

You can never go wrong with a nice C-V-C-V-C or C-V-C-C-V-C name, especially if
the sounds flow nicely. You can end a syllable with any consonant that isn't a
_-y-_ consonant.

### Some Example Names

Kathak, Emyek, Ysedh, Özghun, Dhelkan, Üyü, Selta, Tyashi, Lemzi, Konyu, Pyekha,Györun.
