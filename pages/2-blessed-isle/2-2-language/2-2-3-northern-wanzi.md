# Northern Wànzi Languages

The Northern Wànzi languages are a family of languages that can be found all
along the eastern coast of the Isle. The Northern Wànzi languages originated in
what is today Pangu Prefecture and throughout the river valleys of the Imperial
River. After the Thousand Tragedies, the peoples of the Xianyu peninsula were
the Empress' primary population, and backed her conquests of the mostly-empty
Luo-Han plains and eastern coast. As a result, the Northern Wànzi languages have
spread well beyond their original area.

_Wànzi_ means "from the Wàn" in High Realm. The languages are so named because
of their similarity to Wàn, the Xianyu language which the Empress spoke before
she took the throne. In the modern Isle, more people speak a Wànzi language --
northern or southern -- than any other language family.

## Characteristics of the Northern Wànzi Languages

One characteristic of the Wànzi languages, both Northern and Southern, is the
complete absence of phonemic voicing. Where the old languages of the Isle often
had multiple layers of distinction in their stops, the Northern Wànzi languages
only have two: aspirated (with a puff of air) or unaspirated (without it).

In general, the Northern Wànzi languages do not allow final consonants except
for the single nasal _n_; some go even further and basically remove the _n_ from
the end of syllables, instead making a sort of nasaly vowel sound.

Most northern Wànzi languages feature five tones, one more than High Realm;
scholars who study the written record believe that this reflects the gradual
disappearance of final _-r_ and _-l_ like High Realm has. Most Northern Wànzi
languages have lost their long/short distinction.

High Realm has a few clitics that it still uses to denote parts of the sentence;
most Northern Wànzi languages have abandoned clitics entirely, leaving grammar
up to word order. They very between SOV and SVO word order, the later being
more prominent as you approach the Nuzi language zone. They also generally have
a proper future tense, as opposed to High Realm's past/nonpast distinction; the
future tense seems derived from the High Realm word for _soon_ or _near_.

## Status of the Northern Wànzi Languages

The Xianyu Peninsula and the Imperial River Valley are among the most densely
populated and physically developed regions of the Isle. As a result, their
people -- and by extension, their language -- are viewed as classy and haughty
by their neighbors. The Northern Wànzi languages _sound_ refined, even when
spoken by peasants.

## Accent Features of Northern Wànzi

Northern Wànzi accents are characterized by their nasalizations, by reducing
final _-r_ and _-l_ to "w" sounds, and by their very expressive tone patterns.

## Making A Northern Wànzi Name

Northern Wànzi names sound pretty similar to names in High Realm, but with a
slightly more restricted structure.

### The Sounds

The generic phonology of the Northern Wànzi languages is similar to that of
High Realm. For consonants, you have the following symbols; they are all read
more or less like they are in contemporary Mandarin Chinese: _b_, _p_, _d_, _t_,
_g_, _k_, _z_, _c_, _j_, _q_, _f_, _s_, _x_, _h_, _w_, _l_, and _y_. The
retroflex series of High Realm (_zh_, _ch_, _sh_) has been lost in most Northern
Wànzi languages. The _r_ is available; it is mostly a tap, and does not sound
like Mandarin _r_.

For vowels, you have the basic _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, pronounced fully, as
well as _y_, a sort of middle-of-the-mouth kind of noncommital sound. You can
never put the stress on _y_ as a vowel.

I'd suggest you **ignore tones when making names**.

### The Shape

The Northern Wànzi languages don't allow for any consonants at the end of a
syllable except for _n_; it always becomes _m_ before a _p_, _b_, or _w_, and it
always becomes _ng_ before a _k_, _g_, or _h_. A syllable can have at most one
consonant at the start.

Most Northern Wànzi names will sound pretty similar to High Realm names. That's
okay. They also look like C-V-C-V or C-V-C-V-C a lot of the time, maybe a third
syllable if you want.

### Some Example Names

Zai, Gomen, Kaixe (kye-shay), Woca (woh-tsa), Dyran (duh-raan), Yengku.
