# Radimeli Langauges

The Radimeli languages are a family of languages found at the extreme south of
the Blessed Isle and on the satellite island called Radimel's Seat. Although
today one of the smallest langauge families on the Isle, the See of Radimel was
once an important nautical power which contested the Realm and Arjuf through
their control of the Strait of Garu. Thanks to a longtime colonization of the
shores of the Bay of Radh, today Radimeli languages are spoken both on Radimel's
Seat and on the coast southwest of the Dragonswrath Desert.

The Radimeli languages seem to be related to the Arjufi languages, although they
are also quite dissimilar; it is a case of being more similar to one another
than to anything else. Although small in number and distribution, the Radimeli
languages are still going strong, since they are uncontested for use on the
tropical Seat itself.

## Characteristics of the Radimeli Languages

The Radimeli languages share an element found nowhere else on the Isle, a notion
of _tenseness_: some sounds are produced with force and pressure, almost a catch
in the throat. These distinctly Radimeli sounds are a clear indication that the
coastal languages are Radimeli. In addition, Radimeli also distinguishes voiced
and unvoiced stops, but does not care about aspiration.

Radimeli languages allow more complicated finals than the Arjufi or Wànzi
languages by the combination of liquids and stops. In the middle of a word, only
a single consonant can end a syllable; but at the end of a word, a combination
like _-lk_ or _-nd_ is allowed. Tense consonants cannot end a syllable. They
often do not distinguish _r_ and _l_, tending to _l_.

In general, the Radimeli languages are not tonal, or at the most complicated
have two tones, high and low. Most have a _tone accent_ system, where the stress
of a word is indicated, in part, by a tonal inflection. The Radimeli languages
generally have more than just the five basic vowels: most include _eu_, a sound
like "oo" but without the lips rounded, and/or _ae_, like the "a" in "cat".
Generally these are 'tight' vowels which occur around tense consonants, but they
can also be found independently.

Grammatically, the Radimeli languages often retain the use of clitics, and a
freer word order than the Wànzi languages. Like Arjufi, they often lack tenses
completely, focusing on a variety of aspect/mood distinctions. Like most of the
Eastern Isle's languages, they are analytic, and do not generally use much
inflection or compound words.

## Status of the Radimeli Languages

The Radimeli languages are very laid-back and lazy. They live in a beautiful
and verdant tropical paradise detached from the rest of the world. Island time,
baby. In fiction, pirates and sailors often have Radimeli-type accents.

## Accent Features of the Radimeli Languages

If you want your character to have a Radimeli accent, you might mention some of
the following vocal habits:

- You blend your _r_ and _l_ sounds depending on where they are in the word;
- Your aspirated sounds are particularly sharp;
- In closed syllables, your vowels are more tense and less proper, like using
  the 'a' in "cat" instead of a proper _a_ sound.

Given how small the Radimeli languages are, it is very unusual to encounter a
Dynast with a Radimeli accent. Usually, such Dynasts hail from the island of
Radimel itself, born and raised at a resort town or plantation.

## Making a Radimeli Name

Radimeli names are distinct for including tense consonants and for their
interesting vowels.

> The _tense_ consonants are tense or even ejective. They are written as
> doubles: _pp_, _ss_, etc. For the purposes of English, just pronounce them as
> if they were single.

### The Sounds

For a stereotypical Radimeli name, you should use the following consonant
symbols: _p_, _b_, _pp_, _t_, _d_, _tt_, _k_, _g_, _kk_, _ch_, _j_, _jj_, _m_,
_n_, _f_, _ff_, _s_, _ss_, _h_, _l_. You can use an _r_ if it goes between two
vowels, otherwise use an _l_.

For vowels, make use of the following symbols: _i_, _e_, _a_, _u_, _o_, _ae_,
_eu_, and _ü_ if you think it's cool.

### The Shape

A syllable has a vowel and probably a consonant at the beginning; you can use
any consonant. If you want a tense consonant -- one of the doubled letters --
you have to put it at the start of the syllable.

You can end a syllable with any single-letter consonant, except for _h_. You can
also combine _-l_ with _-p_, _-t_, _-k_, _-m_ if it's at the end of a word.

Two or three syllables will give you a good flow.
