# High Realm

_High Realm_ is the official language of government in the Realm, the language
spoken by the Dynasty, and the most beautiful spoken language in all Creation.
Every Dynast grows up speaking High Realm. High Realm is the court language of
the Empress, and thus bears similarities to other Northern Wànzi languages; but
those peasant tongues are but pale imitations of _real_ High Realm.

> a "ch" sound. _X_ usually makes a "sh" sound.

### Vowels

High Realm uses the following vowels:

|      | Front | Center | Back |
| ---: | :---- | :----- | :--- |
| High | i     |        | u    |
|  Mid | e     |        | o    |
|  Low |       | a      |      |

### Tones

High Realm is a tonal language, which means that the meaning of a word or
syllable depends on the intonation with which it is pronounced. High Realm has
three "short" tones: _normal_, _rising_ (marked like á), and _falling_ (marked
like à). It also has three "long" tones, in which not only is the tone
pronounced, but the vowel is lengthened: _long_ (marked ā), _dipping_ (marked
ă), and _peaking_ (marked â).

The dipping and peaking tones are somewhat unwieldy except in formal speech, so
in most daily conversation, they are simply a long low tone (with no contour) or
a long high tone (with no countour). This is called _rooming one's vowels_, by
analogy with the floor and ceiling of a room. Young Dynasts are often admonished
not to "room" their vowels when speaking to their elders.

High Realm has a strong _tone sandhi_, which means that the actual tones of a
word can shift around based on the words around it. Sometimes, this results in a
word becoming homophonous with another word -- many High Realm puns rely on this
phenomenon.

### Syllables

High Realm syllables can start with at most one consonant, and end in at most
one consonant. Long tones _can_ occur with final consonants, but usually only as
the result of some quirk of sandhi; no roots have long tones in closed
syllables.

> Your names _Jayla_ and _Naiyo_ are perfect examples of High Realm syllables.
> The name _Tempest_ is not possible because the last syllable ends in two
> consonants; in High Realm, her phonetic name might be, for example, something
> like _Munshal_ or _Dibar_ or _Tsinam_ or some other such realization.

## Morphology

High Realm is mostly an _isolating_ language, which means that one word usually
has about one unit of meaning. For example, High Realm has no words like
_handshake_ or _mountaineer_ or _midshipman_ which combine multiple roots
together. The most notable exception is verbs, where High Realm uses a set of
single-syllable suffixes to encode tense and mood.

## Writing

High Realm is written using a system of logograms, wherein one character
theoretically represents one word. Sometimes, logograms are used not for their
meaning, but instead to just represent a syllable. As a result, High Realm is
more appropriately referred to as a _logosyllabic_ script.

High Realm inherits its characters from the Shogunate. Theoretically, this means
that even though they are in another language, many Shogunate texts can be
deciphered by the meaning of the characters. In practice, as any young Dynast
forced to read _The Gate at Peach Mountain Pass_ can attest, it's never that
easy.
