# High Realm and the Northern Wànzi Languages

High Realm is the common language of the nobility and the official language of
all affairs of government within the Realm. Although it is best known as the
language of the Dynasty, High Realm is spoken natively by both Dynasts and
patricians. You can find someone who speaks High Realm anywhere that there is an
official presence of the government.

High Realm is the most characteristic and widespread of the _Northern Wànzi_
languages. These languages are the largest family on the Isle by number of
speakers. They were originally spoken in the northeastern Isle, near the
Xianyu coast, and along the Imperial river valleys. Because of the Empress' use
of High Realm and early conquests during the Unification Period, they are now
spoken along the entirety of the eastern shore.

## Characteristics of the Northern Wànzi Languages

The Northern Wànzi languages, like the other languages of the eastern Isle, do
not distinguish voiced and unvoiced consonants. Unlike the Nuzi languages, they
have also lost the retroflex category (and thus, by extension, have only one
"r" sound). They usually only allow nasals, "r", and "l" as final consonants,
although some languages that border on the Southern Wànzi languages still allow
stops.

The Northern Wànzi languages have, by and large, lost the use of clitics and
variable word order, restricting words to fixed relative positions. They have
a simplified category of tenses compared to their ancestor.

## Characteristics of High Realm

High Realm is more or less an archetypal Northern Wànzi language, displaying all
of the characteristics that make them distinct. All Dynasts and patricians are
raised speaking High Realm, sometimes alongside the local languages.

High Realm is a beautiful and elegant language with many nuances. It has a
strong system of tone sandhi, where tones change based on the preceding and
following tones; sometimes, this makes a plain word homophonous to another. This
system of homophony is the root of many jokes and poetic forms.

High Realm has four tones and two lengths, long and short. The permitted finals
are _m_, _n_, _r_, and _l_; the final _n_ is pronounced as a velar nasal, _ng_.
Final _r_ is rolled, but intermediary _r_ is a tap. The vowels _i_ and _ii_ are
always pronounced in full; they are never reduced, as they would be in some
other Northern Wànzi languages.

High Realm uses an SOV word order, which is usually considered archaic in other
Northern Wànzi languages. High Realm has a past and a non-past tense, as well as
the usual system of moods and aspects. Adjectives are not a distinct category
from nouns; a standalone adjective is a noun meaning, "a thing which is X".

### Romanization of High Realm

> This Romanization section is written **objectively**.

To represent High Realm's status as an elite and educated language, the
romanization of High Realm is based off of the _pinyin_ system of Mandarin
Chinese.

|              |  Labial  | Alveolar  | Post-Alveolar |  Palatal  |  Velar   |
| -----------: | :------: | :-------: | :-----------: | :-------: | :------: |
|       Nasals | /m/ _m_  |  /n/ _n_  |               |           |          |
|    Un. Stops | /p/ _b_  |  /t/ _d_  |               |           | /k/ _g_  |
|   Asp. Stops | /pʰ/ _p_ | /tʰ/ _t_  |               |           | /kʰ/ _k_ |
|  Un. Affric. |          | /ts/ _z_  |   /tʃ/ _zh_   | /tɕ/ _j_  |          |
| Asp. Affric. |          | /tsʰ/ _c_ |  /tʃʰ/ _ch_   | /tɕʰ/ _q_ |          |
|   Fricatives | /f/ _f_  |  /s/ _s_  |   /ʃ/ _sh_    |  /ɕ/ _x_  | /h/ _h_  |
|    Sonorants | /w/ _w_  |  /l/ _l_  |    /r/ _r_    |  /j/ _y_  |          |

Unlike pinyin, the palatals _j_, _q_, _x_ can occur before any vowel, not just
in front of _i_ or _ii_. In these cases, there is usually a strong off-glide.

High Realm has the five classic vowel sounds: _i_, _e_, _a_, _u_, and _o_. Long
vowels are written double; _ii_, _ee_, _aa_, _uu_, and _oo_.

There are four tones: a plan middle tone (a), a rising tone (á), a falling tone
(à), and a peaking tone (â). Tone and length can be combined (for example, a
long falling tone _àà_ as in the High Realm term for Daana'd, _Dàànadá_).

#### What about poor V'neef?

The House names were originally devised in 2001 by someone who didn't have a
coherent aesthetic in mind other than "non-traditional fantasy." As a result, we
get names like _V'neef_ that are somehow supposed to exist in the same language
that gives us names like _Xianyu_ and _Sanqu_ and _Pangu_.

My advice? Ignore it.
