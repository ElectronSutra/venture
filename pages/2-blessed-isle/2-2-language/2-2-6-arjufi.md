# Arjufi Languages

The Arjufi languages are the family of languages on the majority of the Southern
Coast, including the city of Arjuf and the surrounding countryside. The family
covers both shores of the Caracal River, most of the Plains of Rusted Iron, and
skirts the Tarpan Wastes.

The Arjufi languages are epitomized by Arjufi, the language of the city of
Arjuf. They are prominent in the holdings of the historical Triumphate of Arjuf,
and of all language families on the Isle, they are the most deliberately focused
on ensuring their perpetuation. They even have a shared writing system, unique
to the family, which defies House Ledaal's attempts at standardization under the
High Realm script.

## Characteristics of the Arjufi Languages

The Arjufi languages have a simple voiced/unvoiced separation, instead of the
aspirated/unaspirated distinction of their cousins the Northern and Southern
Wànzi languages. They are the only major family of the Isle that sometimes
have two rhotics: a tapped _r_ and a rolled _rr_, which, in City Arjufi, only
distinguish three pairs of words and are thus only weakly distinct.

In almost all studied Arjufi languages, the sound _p_ is entirely absent; it is
always voiced to a _b_ or transformed to an _f_. In City Arjufi, this is taken
even further, since most speakers of that language pronounce _b_ and _v_
identically. Arjufi languages also sometimes feature the _th_ sound, which is
not found except in the Arjufi and Daoshin language families. Most use a
guttural growly _h_ instead of the smooth _h_ of High Realm.

Arjufi languages are not tonal, but do feature an _accent tone_, where the
stressed syllable is pronounced with a different tone than the rest of the word.
Most Arjuf languages do not use an _e_, although City Arjufi does. Unstressed
_a_ and _e_ are always reduced to a schwa sound.

Grammatically, the Arjufi languages are some of the most simple languages on the
Isle. They generally have no tense and only two aspects, complete or incomplete.
They have no plural markers, no articles, no clitics, and rely entirely on
word order to convey meaning. They are topic-prominent and pro-drop wherever
possible.

## Status of the Arjufi Languages

Arjuf is famous for its independent nature and glorious heritage, which the
people of the Arjufi-speaking lands proudly perpetuate. Next to High Realm,
Arjufi has perhaps the most poetry, novels, and plays written and performed
natively. Speakers of the Arjufi languages are generally regarded as
independent, stubborn, and brave. In many parts of the Isle, an Arjufi accent is
a slightly sexy, exotic accent, reminiscent of the hot lands of the South.

## Accent Features of the Arjufi Langauges

If you want your character to have an Arjufi family accent, you might mention
some of the following vocal habits:

- Pronouncing your _h_ like a Hebrew or German _ch_, very guttural instead of
  smooth;
- Rolling your _r_ sounds but tapping them between vowels;
- In High Realm, Arjufi accents often reduce a short _a_ and _e_ to a schwa;
- Unaspirated stops are fully voiced instead of just soft.

Many, many scions of House Ledaal have Arjufi accents, and for a lot of people
in the Dynasty, it might as well be a _Ledaal accent_. Of course, scions of
other Houses can have such an accent as well, but the accent and House Ledaal
are strongly associated with one another.

## The _Bijak_ Script

The _bijak_ or 'wise men' were traditionally an important element of life in the
city of Arjuf, spirit-speakers, poetic warriors, and temple guardians who had
prominent roles as bodyguards and advisors. The bijak developed their own
writing system independently of the rest of the Isle, which most Arjufi
languages have adapted and continue to use today.

Unlike the flowing syllabic calligraphy of High Realm, the bijak script was
originally written on banana leaves, which tear easily when struck in straight
lines. As a result, the bijak script is very swoopy and circular. It is an
_abugida_, which means that each character consists of a base consonant and a
modifying vowel mark. In calligraphy, the swooping forms are often transformed
into waves, leaves, smoke, or other elemental displays evoked by their shape.

## Making an Arjufi Name

Arjufi names are usually pretty straightforward and gratefully easy to spell.

### The Sounds

For an Arjufi name, you should use the following consonants: _b_, _t_, _d_, _k_,
_g_, _ch_, _dj_, _m_, _n_, _ñ_, _v_, _th_, _s_, _z_, _sh_, _j_, _h_, _r_, _l_,
_w_, and _y_. The _j_ is like in French, _dj_ like J in English. If you want an
_r_ to be rolled between two vowels, write it as _rr_.

For vowels, use _i_, _a_, _u_, _o_. If you're from the city of Arjuf, you can
also use _e_, but that's very much a City Thing.

### The Shape

Pick a consonant and a vowel, there's your syllable. If you want to stick a
single consonant on the end, that's cool, too. Use _b_ instead of _v_ at the
end of a syllable; at the start, pick whichever one looks and sounds cooler.

You can end a syllable with _ñ_ if you want, but generally that's hard for
English people to pronounce; I'd just use a plain _n_ if I were you.

### Some Example Names

Pathal, Sobuk, Verath, Karro, Djaza, Miñash, Wuyu, Javi, Dugar, Shim.
