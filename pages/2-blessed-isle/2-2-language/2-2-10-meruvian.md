# The Meruvian Languages

The Meruvian languages are a very broad category, used by contemporary scholars
to identify any language that is primarily spoken in the Imperial Mountain
range. Several scholars have argued that the so-called Meruvian family is, in
fact, several constituent families, pointing to the vast differences between,
say, the speech of Lord's Crossing, the speech of Juche, and the speech of
Mnemon-Darjilis. However, contemporary scholarship largely groups the
"mountain languages" into one large family.

The Meruvian languages do not particularly resemble any of the other language
families on the Blessed Isle. They feature a voicing distinction like the
western languages, but have tones like an eastern language. They also have
several traits that they inherit from the Shogunate period.

## Characteristics of the Meruvian Languages

The Meruvian family is so broad that it is hard to generalize, but a few trends
emerge that are worth noting. First, Meruvian languages _usually_, but not
always, prefer to distinguish voiced/unvoiced from aspirated/unaspirated. This
tendency becomes a rule as one moves west, but aspiration distinction becomes
more common as you move east across the mountains.

Some Meruvian languages have an unusual series of sounds that almost resembles
the tense series of the Radimeli family -- although they are such different
families that it is unlikely they are related. This series of "ejective"
consonants is found almost exclusively in the heart of the mountains, away from
the primary contact points with the outside. Meruvian languages usually don't
allow finals except for _-n_.

Meruvian languages usually have the five vowels, although _u_ is often very,
very weak and sometimes disappears, especially at the end of words. Most only
have 2 tones, if they have tones at all. The vowels _i_ and _u_ often make
changes in the preceeding consonants, like _si_ becoming _shi_. Other Meruvian
languages do away with tone and use length instead.

The grammar of the Meruvian languages is really all over the place, and the
primary reason why a minority of linguists believe the Meruvian family to be
several families. In general, the Meruvian languages have a politeness system,
extensive use of clitics and marker words, and a strong preference for the SOV
word order. The Chiya language and the associated dialects, in and around Lord's
Crossing, are unusual in that they mostly use VSO order.

## Status of the Meruvian Languages

The Meruvian languages are mysterious and old-fashioned for most of the Isle.
They sound like mountains and the old Shogunate. They also sound educated and
archaic, like a moment out of time. In general, the Meruvian accent isn't very
common, since the mountain peoples don't travel far and wide. The exception, of
course, is Dynasts; many Houses have extensive holdings in the mountains and
travel back and forth reasonably often.

## Accent Features of Meruvian Languages

If you want your character to have a Meruvian accent, you might mention some of
the following features:

- You drop your _u_ sound sometimes, especially at the end of the word;
- You have a tendency for _si_ and _su_ to become _shi_ and _shu_;
- When you have a High Realm syllable that ends in an _l_ or an _r_, and a
  tricky consonant at the start of the next syllable, you add a ghostly _i_
  vowel to make things easier to pronounce.

Meruvian accents are relatively common in the Dynasty; House Tepet, House
Mnemon, and House Nellens all have their seats within the Meruvian language
band. Many of the Shogunate's government languages were Meruvian, so lots of
Meruvian words have ended up in general High Realm vocabulary for things like
bureaucracy and military structure.

## Making a Meruvian Name

Meruvian names usually have a couple of syllables, all of which are open -- this
gives them a distinct patter.

### The Sounds

For consonants, make use of the following: _p_, _b_, _t_, _d_, _k_, _g_, _m_,
_n_, _s_, _z_, _h_, _r_, _w_, _l_, and _y_. Before an _i_ or a _u_, make the
following changes:

    ti/tu -> chi/chu,
    di/du -> ji/ju,
    ki/ku -> kyi/kyu,
    gi/gu -> gyi, gyu,
    si/su -> shi/shu,
    zi/zu -> zhi, zhu
    hi/hu -> fi, fu

For vowels, use _i_, _e_, _a_, _u_, _o_. The vowel _u_ is super quiet most of
the time, so you might want to remove it if it's at the very end of a word;
_Pik’_ instead of _Piku_.

I would completely ignore length. If you want to show off length, you can use
a macron: _ā_ for long _a_.

### The Shape

CV is the name of the game for these names. Avoid final consonants. If you
absolutely _must_ make a syllable closed, use _n_.

Throw in a couple syllables -- they're short and easy to pronounce, so you can
have a couple and it'll still be a reasonable name.

### Example Names

Ruyo, Minlo, Azoē, Nairo, Shiu, Aseni, Jishin, Tehou, Jonyon, Zhiruko, Soza.
