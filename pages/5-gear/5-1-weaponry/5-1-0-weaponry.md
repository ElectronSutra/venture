# Weaponry

A weapon is composed of two parts: a _weight_ and a set of _tags_.

## Weight Categories

| Category | Accuracy | Damage | Overwhelming |
| :------- | :------- | :----- | :----------- |
| Light    | +4       | +7     | 1            |
| Medium   | +2       | +9     | 1            |
| Heavy    | +0       | +11    | 1            |

**Category**: All weapons are one of _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_.

**Accuracy**: This is the bonus the weapon gives to the attack pool to hit.

**Damage**: This is the damage the weapon adds to your Strength when making a
**withering** attack.

**Overwhelming**: This is the minimum damage of **withering** attacks with the
weapon, after Soak is accounted for.

## Weapon Tags

_Tags_ are modifiers and descriptors that change the particulars of how a weapon
works.

### Ability Tags
