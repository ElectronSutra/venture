# Casting Spells

Spells are cast by taking the Shape Sorcery action, acquiring a certain number
of sorcerous motes, and then casting the spell.

## Sorcerous Motes

Spells are not cast from your personal mote pools, but rather from a pool of
"sorcerous motes," abbreviated sm.

You can acquire sorcerous motes through your [shaping ritual](/venture/systems/sorcery/initiation#shaping-rituals)
or by taking the [Shape Sorcery](#shape-sorcery) action.

## Shape Sorcery

Shape Sorcery is a combat action which lets you gather up magic. You bind the
world's magic into a coherent form which you will then release to cast your
spell.

Every turn you Shape Sorcery, roll with Occult. Each success generates 1sm. If
you have enough sorcerous motes to cast your spell, you cast it; otherwise, you
may continue to Shape Sorcery and acquire more sorcerous motes.

### Pausing

You can pause Shaping Sorcery to take other actions. Every turn you delay loses
3sm from the casting.

### Changing Spells

If you change the spell you want to cast, you must start Shaping Sorcery all
over again from 0.

## Casting the Spell

Once you have enough sorcerous motes, you cast the spell. Resolve the effect as
listed in the spell's description.

If you successfully cast a spell, you get 1wp back. Hooray!

## Rituals

Some spells have the keyword _Ritual_. These spells cannot be cast by Shaping
Sorcery; instead, you must perform an appropriate ritual. The details are up
to you.
