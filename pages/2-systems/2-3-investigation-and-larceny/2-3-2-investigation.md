# Investigation: the Cat's Art

When pursuing a criminal, you have the following options available to you.

## Case Scene

Use Case Scene to find things that are hidden or might be relevant. This is your
"Find Clues" skill.

Roll with Investigation. It will take you about 15 minutes to half an hour of
searching and turning over cushions. If you succeed, you find anything hidden.

If you are searching for clues, each Case Scene action will either reveal a new
clue, or reveal a new connection between existing clues. You will be told if
there are no more clues or connections to be found.

## Profile Character

Use Profile Character to take the measure of a person -- to determine their
social class, occupation, where they were recently, etc. This is not a magical
know-all, but it allows you to do the Sherlock Holmes "I just met you and I
already know all about you."

Roll (Perception + Investigation) against the target's Guile. If you succeed,
you learn what they are about.

You can also use this action to determine inconsistencies in a person's story.
For example, to determine that the person has mud on their shoes when they claim
they just came from a rocky part of town, etc.
