# Combat Actions

## New Captain Actions

In addition to the normal set of combat actions, the captain gains access to two
new actions that impact shipboard combat: Generate Tempo and Spend Tempo.

### Generate Tempo

The captain may _generate tempo_ for the boat. Roll (Wits + Sail) and generate
1 tempo for every success you roll.

### Spend Tempo

The captain may _spend tempo_ as part of her action, gaining any single effect
listed on the [tempo table](/venture/systems/sailing/combat#tempo-table).

## Everybody Actions

In addition to the normal set of combat actions, all characters aboard the ship
during combat operation gain access to the following actions: Reduce Bilge,
Serve as Crew, Ready Weapons, Take Aim, Fire, and Patch Job.

### Reduce Bilge

You make a roll and _reduce bilge_ on the ship by 1 bilge per success that you
roll.

You may use any combination of Attributes and Abilities to reduce bilge,
depending on how you describe the action. For example:

- Use (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) to reduce bilge by coordinating the response;
- Use (Strength + Athletics) to hold a break and bucket water out of the decks;
- Use (Appearance + Performance) to encourage the crew with a grand display;
- Use (Wits + Occult) to magically coerce the wood to heal itself;

The limit of your ability to use an Attribute/Ability pair is the limit of your
ability to describe a way that that pair can help the ship. Be creative!

### Serve as Crew

You may _serve as crew_ and go where needed to help out with combat operations.
Anyone acting as crew generates tempo for the captain. Roll (Wits + Sail) and
generate 1 tempo per success. You may substitute Bureaucracy or War for Sail,
but take a -3 penalty for doing so.

### Ready Weapons

You instruct the archers or firing crew to ready the weapons, preparing a strike
against an enemy craft.

Roll ([Dexterity, Perception, or Charisma] + [Sail, War, or Archery]) against
difficulty 2. If you succeed, anyone may take a Fire action and launch the
barrage.

### Take Aim

Name a target. The next time the ship fires weapons against that target, the
attack gets +3 raw damage.

### Fire

You take control of the ship's armament yourself and fire the barrage. You must
have the captain's permission or authority to fire the weapons yourself.

You roll ([Intelligence or Perception] + [War or Sail]) to fire shipboard
weaponry.

### Patch Job

You complete a [basic project](/venture/systems/craft/projects#basic-project) to
reduce the number of ship's health levels that count when calculating bilge.
This action does not actually repair the ship; it just reduces the amount of
ongoing hurt.
