# Status

The following statuses have combat effects.

## Crashed

You are Crashed automatically if your Initiative drops to 0 or less. You
automatically lose this status if your Initiative becomes 1 or higher.

You have base Hardness 0 against all **decisive** attacks. Magic cannot increase
this unless it explicitly says so.

You cannot use Charms with the
[_Perilous keyword_](/venture/systems/charms/keywords#perilous).

At the end of your turn, you gain 1 _Crash Recovery_ token. You gain 1
additional token if you did not attack. If you have 3 or more tokens at the
start of your turn, you lose the Crashed status.'

## Onslaught

At the beginning of your turn, if you have any Onslaught status, you lose all
your Onslaught statuses.

**This status stacks**. You automatically gain 1 point of Onslaught every time
you are attacked, even if the attack misses.

While you have Onslaught, your Defense is reduced by 1 for every point of
Onslaught you have. This penalty is called your _Onslaught penalty_.

## Shifted

If you Crash someone who Crashed you, you become Shifted.

In addition to your regular bonus of +5 Initiative for Crashing someone, you
also get to roll Join Battle again and add those successes to your Initiative.

You then lose the Shifted status.

## Clashed

If you attack another character on the same tick that they attacky you, you
become Clashed.

While Clashed, you do not roll against your target's Defense, but instead you
make an opposed roll against your target's attack. The winner is whoever rolls
higher, or if you tie, the player character. For effects that reference Defense,
your Defense is the result of your roll.

Getting hit by an attack while you are Clashed inflicts 3 automatic points of
Initiative damage.

After the attack is resolved, you lose the Clashed status.

## Blinded

You take -3 on all rolls which reasonably involve sight. You get -2 Defense
against all ranged attacks. You cannot read without magic.

You take -5 on all rolls which are completely dependent on sight.

If you have a specialty (While Blind) in any skill, you ignore the penalties
from Blinded while using that skill.

## Deafened

You take -3 on all rolls which reasonably involve your hearing. Attacks which
you cannot see are unexpected.

You take -5 on all rolls which are completely dependent on sight.

If you have a specialty (While Deaf) in any skill, you ignore the penalties
from Deafened while using that skill.

## Crippled

You take -3 on all actions which depend on your disabled or missing limb.

If you are missing a leg, all terrain counts as difficult terrain.

If you have a specialty of (While Crippled) in any skill, you ignore the
penalties from Crippled while using that skill.

## Mounted

You are only Mounted if you are riding something.

You are Reach with all close-range weapons.

You may use Ride instead of Athletics or Dodge for combat movement, and add your
mount's Speed bonus to those rolls.

As long as you have moved since the start of your most recent turn, you can use
Ride instead of Dodge for your Evasion.

After two consecutive turns of moving toward a target, the first attack you make
against the target gets +5 **withering** damage or +3 **decisive** damage as you
run them down.

## Prone

You are on your back. You cannot move except to take the _Rise from Prone_
combat action (difficulty 2). You get -1 Parry, -2 Evasion, and -3 on all
attacks.

## Clinched

You cannot use flurries. You take -2 to your Defense and all Dodge rolls. You
cannot take movement actions unless you are
[_dragging/restraining_](/venture/systems/combat/gambits#restrain-drag). You get
-1 to all attack rolls. You count as being in **close quarters** if you are
Reach.

## Reach

You get 1 automatic bonus success when you make a close-range attack against
defenders who are not Reach. You get +1 Defense against close-range attacks
made by attackers who are not Reach. If you are fighting in **close quarters**
or **low ceilings**, these bonuses instead become penalties.
