# Initiative

Initiative is the heart of combat in _Exalted_. Unlike in many games, where
Initiative is a static value that simply determines order, Initiative in
_Exalted_ is more like a currency. It will go up and down as you go through the
fight, and you spend it for tangible gains.

The most important thing to think about Initiative is that it represents your
_narrative control_. The more Initiative you have, the more you are in control
of the fight--the more you are "winning."

Whenever you see Initiative, think about "narrative control."

## Turn Order

One "instant" in the round is called a _tick_. The first person to act in the
round is whoever has the highest Initiative; they act on the corresponding
tick. Then the next tick, and so on.

## Initiative Value

Initiative ranges from -20 to +20.

### Gaining Initiative

When you start combat, you roll Join Battle with (Wits + Awareness). You start
with 3 Initiative and gain one extra Initiative for every success on your Join
Battle roll.

Whenever you _crash_ an opponent, you gain +5 Initiative.

Whenever you **spend a round without making an attack**, you gain +5 Initiative.

### Losing Initiative

Whenever you are subject to a **withering** attack, you lose Initiative.

Whenever you make a **decisive** attack, you lose Initiative.

Whenever you do to a gambit, you spend Initiative.

## Crash

If you have 0 or less Initiative, you are _crashed_. You are losing control of
the fight and you are on dire straits.

### Crash Bonus

Whenever someone crashes you, they get +5 Initiative.

### Shift

If you crash the person who crashed you, you get a _shift_. In addition to the
regular +5 Initiative bonus, you also get to roll Join Battle again and add
that to your Initiative.

### Resetting from Crash

If you are crashed for two turns, you reset to 3 Initiative at the start of your
third turn.
