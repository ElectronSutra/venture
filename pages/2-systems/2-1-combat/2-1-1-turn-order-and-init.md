# Turn Order and Initiative

Combat begins whenever one character chooses to enact violence onto another and
all participants are **Worthy Foes**. If your opponent is not a **Worthy Foe**,
you don't engage the combat engine; you just roll once to see if you win.

The first thing that happens is that everyone who chooses to fight rolls
[Join Battle](#join-battle) to determine who acts in what order. Then, you take
turns until the combat is over.

## Join Battle

If you **Join Battle by drawing your weapons and entering the fray**, you roll
(Wits + Awareness). You start the fight with 3 Initiative, plus 1 Initiative for
every success on your Join Battle roll.

### Alternative Stats

If you **Join Battle from stealth or seclusion**, you may roll with Dexterity
instead of Wits and/or Stealth instead of Awareness, if you choose.

If you **Join Battle to escalate a conversation to violence**, you may roll with
Manipulation instead of Wits and/or Socialize instead of Awareness, if you
choose.

### Free Action

When you Join Battle, you may perform a single unopposed non-damaging combat
action. For many people, this will be to _Draw/Ready_ your chosen weapon.
Martial Artists may choose to enter a Form. You might choose to take cover
behind an obstacle. Perhaps you choose to activate some kind of Charm to summon
up defenses or allies.

Your free action happens in turn order, allowing individuals who start later to
make an informed decision about offense and defense.

## From the Top

Turn order begins with whoever has the highest Initaive, and proceeds down from
there, skipping any ticks where no one is acting.

On your turn, you can take 1 _combat action_ and 1 _reflexive move_.

After you take your combat action, you may choose to _flurry_ and take a second
combat action by spending Initiative.

Lastly, you gain 5m from combat adrenaline.

### Delaying Your Action

You may always choose to act _after_ you normally would. When it comes around to
your tick, you may declare that you are delaying your action. You hold your
action until you choose to spend it.

### Formal Start-of-Turn Execution

**You do not need to read this section unless there is a timing question.**

At the start of your turn, each of the following happen in order:

1. Effects that last for one turn expire, like Onslaught and hazards or poisons
   which are expired.
2. If you Rushed or Disengaged last turn, and didn't get to move as part of it,
   you can move now.
3. If you are Crashed and have 3 recovery tokens, you cash in all three tokens
   and reset to 3 Initiative.
4. Anima flux and other "at the beginning of turn" effects resolve.
5. Your action and reflexive move reset.

### Formal End-of-Turn Execution

**You do not need to read this section unless there is a timing question.**

At the end of your turn, each of the following happen in order:

1. If you are **not** Crashed or Prone and you did **not** perform an attack,
   gain 5 Initaitive.
2. If you **are** Crashed, gain a recovery token. If you did not attack, gain 1
   additional recovery token.
3. If you flurried, loose 3 Initiative per each of your actions, for a total of
   6 Initiative. If you reach 0 or less Initiative, you become crashed.
4. Regain 5m.

## Initiative

_Initiative_ is your narrative control of the fight. The higher Initiative you
have, the more your character controls the fight. The less Initiative you have,
the more your character is being dominated by the opponent.

During the fight, you will gain and lose Initiative as you turn the tide of
battle to your favor and your opponents attempt to do the same.

In costs, Initiative is represented by the character _i_, for example, _2i_.

### Caps

Initiative cannot exceed 20 or be lowered to less than -20.

### Gaining Initiative

You gain Initiative from taking non-combat actions, or from successfully forcing
and opponent into Crash.

### Losing Initiative

You lose Initiative from being attacked, from spending it on effects, from going
into Crash, and from making **decisive** attack killing blows.
