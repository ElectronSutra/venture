# Attacks

Whenever you take the attack action, you make a choice:

- **Withering**: I am going for my target's narrative control.
- **Decisive**: I am spending my narrative control to permanently harm my
  target.

Cast your mind back to the lightsaber fight video in the introduction. Most of
those blows are **withering** attacks, where they alter the control of the
battle. **Decisive** attacks are the ones that define the fight.

The distinction is purely narrative -- this decision is you, as the director,
saying how you want to storyboard the blow.

## Withering Attacks

**Withering** attacks are projections of killing intent. They include
telegraphing a big blow, dominating with footwork, or threatening action that
forces the enemy on the defensive to keep themselves safe.

### Resolving a Withering Attack

Resolve a **withering** attack as follows:

1. Roll your attack pool against the target's Defense. If you fail, end here.
2. Determine your _raw damage_: Strength + weapon's Damage stat.
3. Reduce your raw damage by your target's Soak, to a minimum of your weapon's
   Overwhelming value.
4. The target loses one point of Initiative for every point of damage they take.

## Decisive Attacks

Decisive attacks are visceral, fight-defining blows that have deadly and present
consequences. A **decisive** attack might be a carefully-calculated precision
cut, a desperate all-out charge, or any other major strike. Although a
**decisive** blow might eliminate a foe from the fight, it also leaves you
vulnerable to a counter-attack.

### Resolving a Decisive Attack

Resolve a **decisive** attack as follows:

1. Declare your _commitment_, between 1 and 20 Initiative.
2. Roll your attack pool against the target's Defense.
3. You lose your commitment. If you failed your roll, end here. If you drop to 0
   or less Initiative, you lose an additional 5 Initiative.
4. Your _raw damage_ is (commitment - target's Initiative); note that that means
   that if your target is crashed, they _add_ to your damage.
5. Reduce your damage to the fight's lethality, if the fight is capped.
6. Roll your damage and do not double 10s. Every success deals 1 point of health
   track damage to your target.
7. If you rolled damage, reset to 3 Initiative if you have less than that.
