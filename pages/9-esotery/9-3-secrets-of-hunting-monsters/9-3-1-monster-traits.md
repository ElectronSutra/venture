# Monster Traits

> This section is impartial.

## Defining a Trait

Monsters are defined by one or more _traits_. A trait is an ineffable and
indisputably true fact about the monster. As long as that monster has that
trait, that fact is simply and nebulously true.

For example, in one of our sessions, you fought a _kiura_. The _kiura_ has the
trait "Invincible and regenerative," so as long as that trait persists, the
_kiura_ cannot be harmed, and will heal any damage it is dealt.

## Discovering a Trait

If you take time to **research a monster**, and that beast resembles something
in your resources or your archives, you can roll (Intelligence + Occult) or
(Intelligence + Lore) to uncover the traits its species are known to possess.

## Weaknesses

Most traits are accompanied by a _weakness_, which is a way that the trait can
be nullified and rendered moot. Continuing our example, the _kiura_'s trait
"Invincincible and regenerative" has a weakness "Bound to a hidden sigil."

When you act on a weakness, you cancel the monster's special trait that it is
tied to. In our _kiura_ example, you acted on the monster's "Bound to a hidden
sigil" weakness by destroying the sigil hidden in the merchant caravan. Since
you acted on the weakness (in this case, destroying the sigil), the _kiura_'s
"Invincible and regenerative" trait was nullified.

## Discovering a Weakness

When you research a monster, you uncover any known weaknesses that accompany the
known traits.

In conflict with a monster, you can use (Wits + Occult) or (Wits + Lore) to
identify a new weakness when it is first exposed. If, for example, the monster
has an aversion to fire, you can use (Wits + Occult) to deduce that when the
monster reacts to heat or light. You may roll the same, but slightly more
difficult, to determine the weakness even without exposure; you've learned it
in a book before, or the monster seems sufficiently similar to something you
already know about.
