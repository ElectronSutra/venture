# Locations of the Triptych Panels

Mnemon Temperance's research allowed her to construct a map of candidates for
the locations of the Triptych panels. The map had five major markings and
several smaller markings.

A triptych is a painting composed of three pieces. It is unlikely that all marks
on the map are correct.

## The Portrait Panel

The portrait panel was originally hanging on display in the House of Burning
Wind, the seat of House Sesus in the city of Chanos. In RY 762, the Chanos
Flicker began to operate in the city, stealing old things at random -- including
the portrait panel, along with several other valuables from the House of Burning
Wind.

The Chanos Flicker was eventually revealed to be an automaton known as
Supervisor (formally designated Eleven Thunder God's-Razor-Destroys-the-Thief),
who was responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of a strange facility high
in the mountains south of Chanos. The portrait panel was stolen specifically to
replace the facility's failing 'central intelligence unit.'

The portrait panel was retrieved by the heroes after delving into the facility
in pursuit of Ragara Sayyah, Ragara Nova, and the blood-witch Ragara Haama. It
was evacuated to the surface during the collapse of the facility, where its
protective power proved essential in helping our heroes survive the heat and
pressure of an erupting volcano.

## The Soldier Panel

The location of the soldier panel is unknown.

## The Deliberative Panel

The location of the Deliberative panel is unknown.
