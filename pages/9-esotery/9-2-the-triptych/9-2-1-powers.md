# Powers of the Triptych

Temperance's notes describe the Triptych as "capable of causing great change."
The exact nature of the change is indeterminable.

Having held a piece of the Triptych, you now concur with Temperance that it is a
powerful object. It is certainly an Artifact of some kind. The nature of the
Artifact remains mysterious.

## Observed Behavior

The automaton called Supervisor selected the portrait panel for use in the
facility beneath the mountains south of Chanos. When asked, Supervisor specified
that the portrait panel was chosen because it had a "powerful emotive and
mnemonic energy resonance" that made it uniquely suited to serve as
replacement for the facility's central intelligence unit.

When Supervisor destroyed the facility by causing a volcanic eruption, the
portrait panel created a bubble of reflective rainbow energy that protected the
group. This bubble was sufficiently powerful to withstand the heat and
pressure inside an erupting volcano.

While the portrait panel was projecting a bubble, the group saw a momentary
glimpse of some kind of figure made of rainbow light, wearing ceremonial
Arjufi garb.
