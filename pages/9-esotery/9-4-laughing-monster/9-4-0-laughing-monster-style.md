# Laughing Monster Style

Laughing Monster Style originates from the teachings of the raksha -- the fae
creatures that live far beyond the edge of the world. In ancient times, the
silvery Anathema and the most radical deviants of the Terrestrial Host studied
their teachings and refined them into this martial form. After all, what better
way to defeat your opponents than to know them?

Laughing Monster Style revels in impetuosity and cruelty. Its practitioners
learn not only to fight with glee, but to find glee in the defeat of their
opponents. They practice strange breathing exercises, trantric methods, rolling
dances, and deep meditations on ego in order to distill their secret selves.
The style survives in secret dojos, criminal syndicates, and hidden societies.
It is a style of thieves, tricksters, revolutionaries, and madmen.
