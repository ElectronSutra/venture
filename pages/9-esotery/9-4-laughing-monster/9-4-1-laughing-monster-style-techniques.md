# Laughing Monster Style Techniques

## Essence 1

### Furiously Stalling Destiny

> **Cost**: 2m; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 2, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Dual, Stackable
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: None

_With a swirling deflection, you turn your attacker's force back against them._

Activate this technique in response to an incoming attack.

You gain +1 Evasion and put a _malice token_ on the attacker.

> **Malice Tokens**: If you attack someone on whom you have placed malice
> tokens, remove all malice tokens from the target and gain +1 effective damage
> per token. If you are making a _gambit_ instead of a damage-dealing attack,
> instead gain +1 automatic success to establish the _gambit_.

You may stack up to (Essence) malice tokens on a single target by using this
Charm. If you put malice tokens onto a target or make an attack against a
target, remove all malice tokens on all other characters.

### Deeper-Into-Trouble Technique

> **Cost**: 3m; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 3, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Damage); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Furiously Stalling Destiny](#furiously-stalling-destiny)

_Your fighting style annoys and provokes your foes as you rain blows on their_
_old wounds and reveal their inadequacies for all to see._

Double 10s on the damage roll. If your target has a negative Tie toward you, add
(Intimacy) bonus dice as well.

If you deal at least one health level of damage, your opponent becomes
_enraged_. While enraged, he gets -3 to attack anyone other than you until he
lands an attack on you. If he crashes you on or before his next turn, he gets
+1wp.

### Laughing Monster Form

> **Cost**: 10m; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 4, Essence 1
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: One scene
>
> **Keywords**: Counterattack, Decisive-only, Form
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Deeper-Into-Trouble Technique](#deeper-into-trouble-technique)

_You adopt a constantly shifting stance. You twist and orient yourself around_
_attacks before they happen. Your limbs revolve with such speed it is as if you_
_hand a dozen illusory arms._

Add (Occult) bonus dice on all counterattacks, Disarm **gambits**, and Distract
**gambits**.

Whenever you successfully dodge an attack and force the opponent to lose
Initiative (through a Charm, missing a **decisive** attack, etc.), you may spend
2i and make a **decisive** counterattack. This counterattack has a base damage
of (Initiative he lost), ignores Hardness, and doesn't include your Initiative
or reset you to base. Instead of using thier lost Initiative to hurt them, you
can choose to use your own Initiative to disarm or distract them, and add their
lost Initiative as a bonus to establish the gambit.

**Special Activation Rules**: You may reflexively enter Laughing Monster Form
whenever you fulfill one of the following conditions:

- You provoke a non-trivial opponent into Joining Battle with an influence roll;
- You cause an enemy's Initiative to drop below your own by dodging an attack.

## Essence 2

### Inauspicious Moment for Attack

> **Cost**: 2m, 1wp; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Clash, Decisive-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Laughing Monster Form](#laughing-monster-form)

_You move suddenly, with a sound like the clapping of 98 hidden hands, and your_
_opponent finds himself thrown into chaos by your sudden appearance in the most_
_inauspicious location._

Clash an incoming attack with a Distract **gambit**; this consumes your attack
for the round and cannot be used if you have already attacked. Roll your
**decisive** attack pool against the incoming attack; if you win, roll to
establish the distraction with one extra die for each threshold success you won
by.

If you successfully establish the Distract **gambit**, it counts as if you had
dodged successfully. The beneficiary of the Distract **gambit** may make an
immediate **decisive** attack against your attacker.

### Subtle Hammer

> **Cost**: 5m; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 5, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only, Restriction (1/scene)
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Inauspicious Moment for Attack](#inauspicious-moment-for-attack)

_A feint and a hidden fist collide, bringing your opponent to his knees._

You may activate this technique after you successfully enact a Disarm or
Distract **gambit**. Make a **decisive** attack against the target with damage
equal to the threshold successes on your roll to establish the **gambit**. This
does not include your Initiative or reset you to base Initiative. If this
attack incapacitates your target, you regain the 5m you spent.

**RESET** -- Successfully clash a non-trivial enemy's attack with Inauspicious
Moment for Attack.

### Thieves Fall Out

> **Cost**: 6m, 2i; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Simple; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Laughing Monster Form](#laughing-monster-form)

_Your attacks are random, without rhythm. They come at weird angles and your_
_foes can't help but feel that you're mocking them. Their rhythm is ruined, and_
_they find themselves tripping over each other as they try to hit you._

Roll a single **decisive** attack against two enemies within close range of
each other. Your raw damage against each of the two targets is (Initiative/2,
round up). If you hit both of them, in addition to dealing damage, you sever
their connection for a moment. For the rest of the scene, whenever they are in
close range of each other they take -1 Defense. If one starts his turn within
close range of the other, you leach 1i from him.

Instead of targeting two individuals, you may target a battle group. If you do
so, double your effective damage for calculating the **decisive** bonus damage
against the battle group (**Core**, p. 208). The battle group suffer -1 Defense
for the rest of the scene and lose 1 Magnitude at the start of their turn.

### Friendship-Dissolving Venom

> **Cost**: 3m, 3i, 1wp; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 4, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Reflexive; **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Dual, Perilous
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Thieves Fall Out](#thieves-fall-out)

_Your strange style pulls at the heartstrings and turns sister against sister._

You may use this technique after you successfully dodge an incoming attack. If
both targets are under the penalties of [Thieves Fall Out](#thieves-fall-out),
you do not need to pay 1wp for this technique.

Redirect the attack to instead target any Crashed or trivial enemy within range
of the attacker. The attacker must reroll their exact same attack against the new
target, retaining all bonuses, penalties, and magic that enhanced the original
attack.

If the attack is a **withering** attack, _you_ leech the Initiative instead of
the attacker. If the target has any malice tokens, the redirected attack
benefits from them (and does not remove them from the new target).

In addition to dealing damage, if the redirected attack roll exceeds the
target's Resolve, the target forms a minor Tie (Outrage) against the attacker,
or strengthens an existing Negative Tie by one step. Any positive Ties that he
has towards that attacker are treated as if they do not exist for the rest of
the scene. You may roll (Manipulation + [Presence or Socialize]) to persuade the
target to act against the attacker's interests.

### Unitary Being Forge

> **Cost**: 6m, 1wp; **Mins**: Laughing Monster Style 5, Essence 2
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Damage roll); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only
>
> **Prerequisite Charms**: [Laughing Monster Form](#laughing-monster-form)

_You strike a target and their mind is splayed open for a moment, allowing an_
_imp to escape and manifest onto the battlefield._

You may use this Charm against an enemy with a negative Tie of which you are
aware. Reroll (Intimacy) failed dice on the damage roll.

If you deal at least (target's base Resolve) levels of damage, the Intimacy is
torn from their mind and becomes an _imp_. The imp is semi-solid. It is ugly.
Its appearance clearly displays the nature and intensity of the affected
Intimacy; anyone who looks at it learns these two facts. Creating the imp is a
_mental shaping effect_.

The imp hovers around the victim. It moves automatically with the victim and it
is impossible to separate the imp to further than Close range from the victim.
The victim loses all positive effects (but keeps all negative effects) of the
Intimacy for the rest of the scene. The victim's Guile is halved for the rest of
the scene.

Once per round, you may have the imp add (lower of Intimacy or your Essence)
bonus dice of **decisive** damage to any attack made against the victim. The
imp can be destroyed with a rank (Intimacy) gambit, but has (your Guile)
Defense and is dematerialized. If the imp is destroyed with magic that
permanently destroys spirits, the Intimacy is automatically and irresistibly
weakened one step.
