# Armor

Like weapons, armor is represented as a combination of a _weight_ and a set of
_tags_.

## Weight Categories

| Category | Soak | Mobility Penalty | Hardness |
| :------- | :--- | :--------------- | :------- |
| Light    | +3   | 0                | 0        |
| Medium   | +5   | -1               | 0        |
| Heavy    | +7   | -2               | 0        |

**Category**: All armor is one of _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_.

**Soak**: This is the bonus that the armor adds to your Stamina to determine
your Soak.

**Mobility Penalty**: This is the penalty that the armor applies to your
movement actions while wearing it.

**Hardness**: This is the Hardness the armor gives you.

## Armor Tags

_Tags_ are modifiers that change how the armor behaves.

### General Tags

**Artifact**: Artifact armor uses the following chart instead:

| Category | Soak | Mobility Penalty | Hardness |
| :------- | :--- | :--------------- | :------- |
| Light    | +5   | 0                | 4        |
| Medium   | +8   | -1               | 7        |
| Heavy    | +11  | -2               | 10       |

### Other Tags

**Buoyant**: This armor does not apply the mobility penalty to aquatic movement.

**Concealable**: This armor is light enough to be hidden under bulky clothes.

**Silent**: This armor does not apply the mobility penalty to silent movement.
