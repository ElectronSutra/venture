# Weaponry

A weapon is composed of two parts: a _weight_ and a set of _tags_.

## Weight Categories

| Category | Accuracy | Damage | Overwhelming |
| :------- | :------- | :----- | :----------- |
| Light    | +4       | +7     | 1            |
| Medium   | +2       | +9     | 1            |
| Heavy    | +0       | +11    | 1            |

**Category**: All weapons are one of _light_, _medium_, or _heavy_.

**Accuracy**: This is the bonus the weapon gives to the attack pool to hit.

**Damage**: This is the damage the weapon adds to your Strength when making a
**withering** attack.

**Overwhelming**: This is the minimum damage of **withering** attacks with the
weapon, after Soak is accounted for.

## Weapon Tags

_Tags_ are modifiers and descriptors that change the particulars of how a weapon
works.

### Ability Tags

**Brawl/Melee/Martial Arts**: These tags indicate that the weapon is an up-close
weapon. Weapons with the `Brawl` or `Melee` tag use their associated Ability.
Weapons with the `Martial Arts` tag require special training to use; either at
least 1 dot of a relevant Martial Art _or_ a Specialty in that weapon.

**Archery (_distance_)**: This weapon is is ranged. It can make attacks out to
the indicated _distance_. Use the following table instead of the weapon's
usual Accuracy:

| Close | Short | Medium | Long | Extreme |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :--- | :------ |
| -2    | +4    | +2     | +0   | -2      |

**Thrown (_distance_)**: This weapon can be thrown. It can make attacks out to
the indicated _distance_. Use the following table instead of the weapon's usual
Accuracy when it is thrown:

| Close | Short | Medium | Long | Extreme |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :--- | :------ |
| +4    | +3    | +2     | -1   | -3      |

### Damage Tags

**Bashing**: This weapon deals bashing damage.

**Lethal**: This wepaon deals lethal damage. You can always use a stunt to deal
bashing damage instead.

### Other Tags

**Artifact**: This weapon is an _Artifact_. Add +1 to the accuracy value; +2 to
the damage value; and +2/+3/+4 to the Overwhelming value depending on the
weight.

**Balanced**: Increase the weapon's Overwhelming value by 1.

**Chopping**: This weapon allows you to make a Chopping attack. A Chopping
attack reduces your Defense by 1 until your next turn, but increases your
**withering** damage by 3 _or_ reduces the target's Hardness by 2.

**Concealable**: This weapon can be hidden on your person with a difficulty 1
Larceny roll.

**Crossbow**: This weapon adds +4 damage in place of using your Strength,
regardless of your actual Strength value.

**Disarming**: This weapon reduces the difficulty and cost of a Disarm gambit
by 1.

**Flame**: This weapon shoots fire. This tag behaves like the _Crossbow_ tag,
with the additional restriction that Charms cannot increase the range of attacks
made with this weapon.

**Flexible**: This weapon ignores the Defense bonus from a Full Defense action.

**Grappling**: This weapon can be used to make a grappling attack.

**Hefty**. This weapon is too heavy to be used on horseback.

**Natural/Worn**: This weapon cannot be disarmed. Natural weapons are part of
your body; worn weapons are something you wear.

**Piercing**: This weapon allows you to make a Piercing attack. A Piercing
attack costs 1i and lowers the target's Defense by 1 until their next turn. If
the attack is **withering**, it ignores 4 points of soak.

**Poisonable**: This weapon can be poisoned.

**Reaching**: This weapon negates the advantage of mounted targets.

**Shield**: This weapon reduces its damage bonus by 2. You may flurry Full
Defense with Rush and Withdraw actions. If you choose to take only Full Defense,
you boost your Parry by 3 instead of by 2.

**Slow**: This weapon requires an action to reload.

**Smashing**: This weapon allows you to make a Smashing attack. A Smashing
attack costs 2i. You reduce your Defense by 1 until your next turn and send your
target flying 1 range band away or knock them prone.

**Subtle**. This weapon cannot deal damage; it can only be used to inflict
poison.

**Two-Handed**: You may use Strength instead of Dexterity when making attacks
with this weapon.
