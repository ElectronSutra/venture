# Melee Weapons

The Realm is heavily influenced by Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, and Roman
cultures, which means that many of the weapons may _look_ different than you
expect. Here are some aesthetics for weapons that you may not have been aware
of.

## Light Melee Weapons

### Club, Cudgel, or Bludgeon

A club can be as simple as a length of wood or an iron bar, or it may be made
with bindings and wraps. Small improvised weapons are often clubs.

#### Chuí

A _chui_ is a long metal cudgel with a fist-sized bulb at the end. _Chuí_ are
often wielded in pairs. Temple guards frequently carry _chuí_, as do bandits.
