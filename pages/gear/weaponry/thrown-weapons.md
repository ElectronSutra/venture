# Thrown Weapons

The Thrown Ability is used for any weapon that is propelled by arm strength
rather than by the internal strength of the weapon (eg. tensinon in a bow). Many
melee weapons can be thrown if they are light enough.

## Light Thrown Weapons

### Bola

A bola is a throwing weapon made up of several weights on the ends of cords that
meet in the center. By throwing the bola, you can tangle the legs of an animal
or foe and cause them to smack to the ground. Bolas are often used if hunting
while mounted, or used to subdue game fowl before they are able to fly away.

### Charkam

A chakram is a metal disk intended for throwing. The razor-sharp outer edges
cut through ropes and light armor.

### Dart

A short dart about 1 foot long, intended to pierce armor.

#### Kunai

A kunai is a special type of dart or dagger, also called a throwing knife. It is
a long, narrow knife optimized for throwing, often with a unique quadrilateral
shape and wrapped handle.

### Needle

A tiny glass or metal needle. Thrown through the air at high velocity, it embeds
a poison or disease into the target.

### Shuriken

Also called a throwing star, a shuriken is a star-shaped metal blade.

### Sling

Don't think of a silly little slingshot -- oh no, this is a _sling_, like the
Greeks used to kill Persians. A bullet is placed into a pouch, which is then
swung around the head at high velocity and the pouch released. Slings are able
to throw incredibly far, even out to long range.

## Medium Thrown Weapons

### Atlatl

A simple wood or metal base on which a dart is mounted, the atlatl is one of the
oldest hunting weapons in Creation. By adding leverage, this tool allows you to
throw a dart more powerfully, more accurately, and further than you could with
your bare hands. This improvement is significant enough to move the dart into
Medium weapon stats.

### Sling Staff

By attaching a sling on the end of a long staff, you increase your spin and make
the weapon stronger. Regular sling bullets can already rip a barbarian's head
open; with a sling staff, you can do it even better.

### War Boomerang

Be like Sokka, fight with a boomerang. Boomerangs are exceptional among thrown
weapons in that they are designed to return to you once you have thrown them,
if they fail to hit their target.
