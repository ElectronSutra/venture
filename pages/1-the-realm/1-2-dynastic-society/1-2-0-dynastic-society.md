# Dynastic Society

The Realm is Creation's most just and successful society. Depending on who you
ask, this is either _because of_ or _in spite of_ its noble class, the
_Dynasty_. The Dynasty is composed of the Empress' personal family and the
Great Houses. They are responsible for leading the Realm, creating and defining
laws, defending the Realm, and guiding society toward a moral and successful
future.

It is the natural right of the Dynasty to hold all of Creation like a pearl in
a dragon's claw. All that stands between the Dynasty and global hegemony... Is
the Dynasty itself.
