# The Deliberative

The Deliberative is the Realm's legislative body -- but only somewhat. Although
the Deliberative holds fiat to draft laws in many areas that are binding unless
vetoed by the Empress, they are technically only an advisory body to the
Empress' authority.

The Deliberative is a hotbed of politics, where Great Houses, patrician
families, and all manner of minister meet and mingle to offer their counsel on
national policy. Members of the Deliberative are known as Senators or
Counselors, though the distinction of who is a Senator and who is a Counselor is
unclear to most everyone that isn't one of them.

## The History of the Deliberative

The Deliberative began with the Empress' Table, a small group of the Empress'
daughters and trusted counsel who would dine in the evening with the Empress.
She would pry their minds for policy and encouraged debate among them,
sifting their best ideas into early policy.

In RY 103, the Empress was facing internal pressure from critics about the
failed invasions of the River Province. In order to quell their criticisms, she
expanded the Empress' Table to include several new members. As the organization
grew, she modeled it more and more after the tribal assemblies of the WÃ n from
her youth, which gave rise to the various chamber-colleges that exist today.

The Deliberative was formally established as a fiat entity at the end of RY 103.
Shortly thereafter, the Empress ordered the construction of the Palace of the
Deliberative to house her advisors.

In the beginning, the Deliberative was a strictly advisory body, simply a forum
by which the Empress would seek counsel from the Houses. As the Deliberative and
the Realm continued to grow, the Empress gradually expanded their fiat to
include the authority to pass laws on her behalf on many topics in which she
held little interest, from fishery regulation to national holidays.

Nowadays, the Deliberative has expanded to include three chamber-colleges, and
holds fiat on a staggering array of minutiae -- all subject to imperial veto. It
is the largest governmental body in all of Creation, seating thousands of
Senators and Counselors from across the Realm to debate and advise.

## The Chamber-Colleges

The _chamber-colleges_ are the three constituent bodies of the Deliberative,
each tasked with different areas of concern. Each chamber-college is in turn
divided into benches and panels. The functions of the chamber-colleges are as
confusing as they are diverse; their duties are confusing, redundant, and
often contradictory, much like the members of the Deliberative themselves.

The chamber-colleges originated as rooms (hence, chambers) for colleagues
(hence, college) to meet, have tea, and discuss affairs. Different groups would
naturally address different topics, and drift to the same room for their
meetings. Eventually, this was formalized into the chamber-colleges we know
today.

### The College of Matriarchs

The _Most Potent Chamber-College of the Pious and Venerable Matriarchs_ is the
modern incarnation of the original Empress' Table, and still often referred to
by that term. It represents the interests of the Great Houses to the Empress.

Technically, the College of Matriarchs consists of the ten current Matriarchs
and the Mouth of Peace. Each Matriarch and the Mouth of Peace herself retain the
authority to sit on the college in-person. However, the affairs of state
inevitably lead to their presence being a rarity. The Matriarchs and the Mouth
of Peace are usually present in the form of representatives, who sit in the
college on their behalf. The Empress requires that matriarchs who send
representatives send **at least** two -- since no individual is as wise as the
matriarch -- so the College of Matriarchs is usually much larger than its
nominal 11 members.

In addition to their meetings in the Matriarch's Room of the Palace of the
Deliberative, the College of Matriarchs still periodically meets with the
Empress over formal dinners to debrief her as to the status of the Deliberative.
Her Radiance attends in person often enough that it is not a surprise, but more
often sends her majordomo Amon Mora in her place.

The College of Matriarchs has no votes and no subdivisions. It acts strictly as
the Empress' privy council.

### The College of Dignitaries

The _Great Chamber-College of Most Inspired and Noble Law-Making Among the_
_Dignitaries of the Realm_ numbers hundreds of members advocating for the
interests of the patriciate and dignified, assorted nobility of the Realm.

The College of Dignitaries houses over 100 votes, which are assigned to various
benches, territories, and inviduals according to the chambers' bylaws and the
Empress' will. Some individuals have a dignity that grants them a vote on their
own -- but most votes are assigned to benches, which are composed of many
members who vote as one. Many Dignitary members sit on multiple benches. Thus a
single person may have her fingers in many different votes, but no vote to
herself.

The College of Dignitaries is _not_ representative. Members have no burden to
represent constituents or whatever. Membership is entirely about deliberation,
discussion, status, and courtly procedure. The College of Dignitaries does not
create legislation -- it simply offers advice (as shown by the votes) on what it
would like to see done at a national level.

Some important benches of the College of Dignitaries include:

- The **Honorable Bench of the Ancestral Blood-Right**, which represents the
  interests of the Realm's Princes Subservient, except for those Princes
  Subservient which have a voting dignity themselves. The current chair of the
  Blood-Right Bench is Mat Asma, who is one of V'neef's most vocal allies in the
  College of Dignitaries.
- The **Holy Bench of the Eastern Conferential Synod** represents the interests
  of the Immaculate monasteries and abbacies scattered throughout the Eastern
  Isle. It's counterpart, the Western Synod, is much younger. The Eastern Synod
  is notoriously fractious; it is rare for a chair to retain her chair for
  longer than a year, and never more than a few.
- The **Most Favoured Bench of the Loyal Patriciate** is _supposed_ to represent
  the interests of the patrician families, except for the fact that many
  patrician families have their own voting dignity. The bench thus represents
  only the non-dignified patrician families, and often votes _against_ the
  interests of the independent patrician families out of spite. The patrician
  bench is infamous for rampant absenteeism and a complete inability to reach
  an internal decision, except to screw over the "traitorous" voting families.
- The **Armipotent Bench of Her Radiance's Marshals** represents the interests
  of the Empress' Crown Marshalls and Legions. The Marshal Bench has no actual
  vote, but must be present for the Dignitaries to vote on matters of war or
  Legion business. Its influence is thus unofficial, but widespread.

### The College of Executives

The _Revered Chamber-College of Contemplative Executives in Prudent Debate_ is
the largest of the three college-chambers by a wide margin, seating over a
thousand members and divided into over 400 voting bodies. The Executives are
supposed to represent the interests of governors, ministers, satraps, prefects,
magistrates, and monks.

Unlike the Dignitaries, the Executives rarely petition the Empress or attempt to
influence her policy. Instead, the Executives are where the actual law that the
Deliberative is afforded by fiat comes from. It votes on matters ranging from
allocating infrastructure funding to the rules and regulations of commercial
forestry to the national tax rate on beer.

The Empress is, of course, informed of these votes, and all are recorded and
presented to Her Radiance's Throne Chamber for her consideration. But since the
Empress has little care for these minutiae, the Executive chamber-college
largely runs itself -- and thus, the Realm.

Some important benches and panels of the College of Executives include:

- The **Loyal Bench of the Far-Ranging Satrapies**, which represents the
  interests of the satraps, except for the four satraps who have their own
  individual votes. The _satrapial governments_ have no representation in the
  Deliberative at all; the Satrapy Bench represents the interests of
  _the satrapial profession as a whole_.
- The **Rigorous Bench of the Investigative Magistracy** provides representation
  for the Empress' magistrates, but has no formal vote. The Bench has fought for
  centuries to establish its right to vote -- but the bylaws of voting
  allocation are managed by the College of Dignitaries, who have little interest
  in giving the magistrates even a shred of authority.
- The **Sovereign Bench of the Free City of Arjuf** represents the interests of
  the city of Arjuf, but not Arjuf Dominion as a whole, nor of House Ledaal. The
  issue of whether or not the Sovereign Bench gets a vote has been adjudicated
  many times across the centuries of the Deliberative; currently, it can only
  vote in accordance with a plebiscite among the land-owning Dragon-Blooded of
  the city.
- The **Sacred Bench of the Pearls of Earthly Wisdom** is the voice of the
  Isle's networks of secondary schools. Currently, it consists of four members,
  each representing the Big Four schools. It is ajoined by the _Honorable_
  _Bench for the Education of Lost Eggs_, which represents the interests of
  Pasiap's Stair, but has no formal weight on how the Sacred Bench casts its
  vote. This is an endless annoyance to the Stair, who is known to send her
  most disagreeable representatives as retribution for her inability to vote.
