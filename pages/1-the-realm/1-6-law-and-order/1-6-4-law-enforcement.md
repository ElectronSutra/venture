# Law Enforcement

Magistrates handle internal affairs of the process of government, and judges
handle the sentencing and punishment; but when it comes to actually catching
criminals, that's the duty of law enforcement. On the Isle, law enforcement
usually falls two major organizations.

## Organizations

### Black-Helms

The _Guardians of Peace and Order In the Realm_ are sometimes called _Guardians_
when someone is being polite, but are usually known as the Black-Helms. The
Black-Helms enforce the laws on peasants -- they're the ones that catch
pick-pockets, smugglers, and so forth.

Black Helms are known for their distinctive helmets, big conical things made
with black scale. They all have a fancy red belt with a seal on it: a pentagram
cast in bronze. Usually they've got swords or a pike.

Black-Helms are mostly beneath the notice of the Dynasty; there's no reason for
Dynasts to interact with them. Mostly, it's just kind of trusted that the
Black-Helms are doing their job okay -- after all, if they weren't, the peasants
and slaves would be having all sorts of horrible rebellions all over the place!

### Silver-Belts

The _Force for Imperial Safety in the Homeland_ are also called the Force, but
most people know them as the Dragon-Handlers. These are the guys a Dynast should
be wary of -- they're the ones who actually do the arresting when a magistrate
decides to stick their nose into someone's business.

They're identifiable by their silver sashes and buckles, with the red jade
pentagram. Many Dynasts have childhood stories of some relative who got hauled
off by the Silver-Belts for causing too many problems. They're all serious,
dangerous people -- they have to be, if their job is to haul away Princes who
get on the wrong side of the law. Many of the Silver-Belts have a Prince leading
their unit, so that things will go smoothly.

## Crimes

All sorts of crimes take place in the Dynasty: espionage, assassination, duels,
breaking-and-entering. It's kind of just accepted that a lot of this goes down
on the daily somewhere on the Isle and it's not the end of the world as long as
things are kept subtle.

The kinds of crimes that end up in court are generally pretty fancy -- stuff
like money-laundering schemes to turn criminal income into legitimate cash, or
schemes of embezzlement, or paying off bandits, that sort of thing. A lot of
them have cash or murder at the heart. Judges have to be extra careful when
dealing with Chosen cases.

The more visceral kind of crimes happen too, although not as frequently. Murder,
assault, arson... All those dirty, savage crimes still happen, and that's when
the Silver-Belts get involved with a Magistrate and shit really hits the fan.
Most such crimes end up being huge topics of gossip.

As for peasants... Who knows. Who cares? They're probably always killing each
other over whose rice is whose and punching each others' big stupid faces for
bedding someone's spouse's cousin, and so on. Whatever kind of mischief the
peasants get up to, they don't generally end up in court.
