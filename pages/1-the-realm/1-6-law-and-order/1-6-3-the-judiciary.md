# The Judiciary

Judges are the backbone of the Realm's legal system. Appointed by various
authorities, judges hold fiat to render judgement in the Empress' authority on
various issues, ranging from land cases to exeuctions to fishing regulations to
animal welfare.


## The Judiciary System

### Shun the Perfidious Lawyer

Some foreign nations have "lawyers," professionals who make a profession of
twisting the law in favor of private clients. The Realm explicitly forbids such
practices. All parties are expected to offer their own arguments and defend
their own points of view.

In practical terms, however, the law still allows for "friends" and
"compatriots" to offer defense on behalf of a party, as long as such
representation is free and out of their own good will. This leads, as a matter
of course, to some dubious individuals who are both exceptionally friendly --
why, it seems they are a friend to almost everyone! -- and very well-versed in
the details of the law. Naturally, such people, with such extensive networks of
"friends," often find themselves in lavish abodes with ample food and access to
goods, as "gratitude" for favors performed many years ago.

So it goes; and while such practices skirt the spirit of the law, they are so
convenient that they largely go without note.

### Inquisitorial Proceedings

The Realm's legal system is an _inquisitorial_ system, which means that the
judge acts as the jury and the primary opponent of each side in the case. The
judge is the one who asks mosts of the questions, interrogates most of the
witnesses, and consulting with local law enforcement for the facts of the case.

Each side is present not to argue their case, but to defend it from the judge's
questions. Judges can summon witnesses of their own accord, and then consider
the defenses and appeals from both sides when rendering their decision.

### That Which Is Below the Interest of the Court

Judges are busy, and retain broad powers to render summary judgements on matters
of little interest to the court. When the judge believes that a case is
_prima facie_ clear and uncontroversial, they can issue a summary judgement
without convening a full court. This method accounts for a huge chunk of the
arguments that people attempt to bring to court. Judges can also dismiss cases
summarily for failing to meet standards of evidence or for one party being
without merit -- often the case when peasants complain to a judge about the
Great House, which is usually in the right.

This broad authority keeps the courts from being bogged-down in clear and
uncontroversial decisions, and keeps the focus of the judiciary on things that
are most important. It also, conveniently, allows the Great Houses -- through
their judges and ties -- to summarily dismiss many of the cases that might bog
them down.

### Types of Judges

Judges are appointed by Her Radiance herself, known as _Imperial judges_. These
judges are the most respected scholars of the law and the ones most qualified to
render judgement on intricate, expansive cases.

Prefectures need their own judges as well, since law needs to happen everywhere.
The prefect can appoint judges as _prefectural judges_, whose appointment can be
overturned by the Empress at any time without question -- or by magistrates
acting on behalf of the Empress who determine sufficient corruption. Prefectural
judges are very common.

Some large cities such as Arjuf and Chanos have enough local cases to appoint a
_municipal judge_ on the authority of the city governor, who are in most ways
equivalent to a prefectural judge but with much more limited jurisdiction:
affairs of the city and its citizens.

### Chain of Appeals

Losing parties may appeal their decisions to a higher authority, requiring them
to travel physically to meet with a higher judge. In general, the cost and
burden of travel is such that the appeals process is rare. Appeals judges can
also decline to hear cases, allowing the original judgement to stand.

In general, decisions of a single judge can be appealed to a tribunal of judges,
none of whom will be the original judge; usually this requires traveling to the
seat of the prefect, which can take a significant amount of time. Decisions of
a tribunal can be appealed to an Imperial judge, who usually resides even
further away. Determinations of the Imperial judges are final, unless overruled
by the Empress.

## Life of a Judge

The life of a judge is difficult to generalize, and depends highly on the local
situation. Rural judges lead a different life than urban judges, who live much
differently than satrapial judges, and so forth.

### The Universal Experience

Regardless of where they are appointed, judges are figures of respect and
authority. They literally speak in the authority of the Empress and/or the
Deliberative on matters of law and have wide-ranging fiat to enact punishment on
law-breakers.

All judges are scholarly, and devote ample time to the study and execution of
the law. Although judges may reach any conclusion given the appropriate
circumstances, making sure that new decisions are in line with previous
decisions is important to make sure the decisions are respected. Judges command
respect for their power and exemplify the scholarly aspects of the nobility.

Judges speak with the voice of their sponsor, which is ultimately the voice of
the Empress herself. All judgements in the Realm are products of the Empress,
and offered in her name. As a result, judges are held to extremely high
standards -- and kept in line by the constant fear of magistrates descending
upon them. Corruption and abuse of power are rampant, but judges must be careful
in how they express it, and maintain a facade of decorum.

Every judge has a seal bearing the mon of the Empress -- the Imperial Mountain
and a crane. Beneath the seal of the Empress, the judge speaks with unrivaled
authority. All words spoken beneath the Seal are transcribed and recorded. All
actions are noted. It is said that the Empress sees all that takes place beneath
her Seal -- a belief which many peasants and judges take quite literally.

### Urban Judges

Judges who sit in cities and large towns usually operate out of a proper
courthouse, which is outfitted with a full array of judicial paraphenalia --
stenographers, courtrooms, archives, the whole shebang. Urban judges are often
outfitted with expensive robes and fancy chairs, some of which are, naturally,
gifts from grateful citizens who appreciate the judge's wisdom.

Urban judges dwell in areas of political theater, and so are often prominent
figures in local politics. From towns barely large enough to seat a judge to
sprawling cities like Arjuf and Eagle's Launch, the local judge or judges can
sway local politics just by expressing an opinion to the right people.

### Rural Judges

The Empress'law does not exist only in cities. Even the lowliest sheepherder in
the middle of nowhere is subject to her authority -- and thus, subject to
judgement by her courts. To facilitate this, many judges are _not_ confined to
just the cities -- their jurisdictions include huge rural areas.

Rural judges travel often, in a big caravan with bodyguards and equipment to
carry out the work of the law. They bring yurts and platforms with which to hold
court, carried on the backs of yaks, yeddim, and horses. They dress in practical
traveling gear, and travel long, slow circuits to the rural communities that
need their judgement. They hike up mountains, ford across streams, slide along
narrow cliff paths. Some judges have entire wagons fitted as traveling
courthouses, the Empress' Seal proudly emblazoned on the door proclaiming her
ever-watchful gaze.

Rural judges rarely have the time to establish major political blocks in the
way that urban judges do, but their arrivals are heralded with celebration. Many
peasant communities view judges as the Empress' benevolent intervention to deal
with local problems. In some communities, the annual arrival of the judge for a
week is the only contact with the outside world other than the taxmen, and the
judges bring settlements and order, not empty carts to haul away hard work.
