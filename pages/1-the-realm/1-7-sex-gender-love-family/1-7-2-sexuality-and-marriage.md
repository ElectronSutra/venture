# Sexuality

The most important thing which a Dynast can do for her family is produce
children and continue the gift of the Dragon's Blood. As such, marriage and sex
are vitally important. The public, however, has no desire to know such things;
indeed, discussing one's sex life is viewed as rude, braggadocious, and
arrogant.

Public discussion of relationships focuses instead on _marriage_ and sometimes
on _romance_.

## The Three Rooms

The _Three Rooms_ is an old poetic metaphor which describes relationships and
sexuality within the Dynasty. Many young Dynasts learn about the Three Rooms
through studying the classics, and then gradually learn to expand the metaphor
beyond relationships and into sexuality.

The Three Rooms metaphor divides a Dynast's romantic and sexual relationships
into three separate rooms. These rooms are viewed as entirely distinct from
one another; what happens in one room ought not to affect the others.

A typical Dynast is married, and keeps an array of (mostly same-sex) lovers on
the side. Such an arrangement is viewed as entirely faithful -- her time with
her lovers is not disloyal, because it is a different _kind_ of love than the
marriage. It is fully accepted, as long as such things remain out of sight and
do not produce illicit children.

### The Jade Room

The _Jade Room_, also sometimes called the _Parlor_, is the public sphere of
relationships and sexuality. For most Dynasts, their marriage resides in the
Jade Room. Children and family are products of the Jade Room. In public, you go
to parties with your spouse and mingle with others; this space, where love is
seen, is the Jade Room.

Jade Room relationships are prototypically heterosexual, because they exist for
the purpose of producing heirs. Homosexual relationships certainly exist, but
not with the same frequency. Relationships in the Jade Room are expected to be
cordial, but are also thought of as dispassionate and formal -- they are not
affairs of the heart, but instead, affairs of the House. Sex in the Jade Room is
rarely for love's sake, and more often for spousal harmony and for heirs.

### The Flower Room

The _Flower Room_, sometimes called the _Garden_, is the private sphere of
relationships and sexuality. For most Dynasts, the Flower Room is where their
relationships to their lovers and romance most lie. The Flower Room is where the
Dynasty retreats from the public eye to indulge their passions and find the
deep connections their marriages often lack.

The Flower Room is protoypically homosexual, and almost always features partners
from different social classes. It is the sphere of romance, where kisses are
soft, the sheets are silken, and candlelight dinners are accompanied by
stirring instrumentals. Relationships in the Flower Room are not expected to be
lifetime commitments like marriage, and many Dynasts take an array of lovers
behind closed doors.

Dynasts are not only expected and accepted to have an array of Flower Room
dalliances, but are often subtly encouraged to do so, as a way to find the
satisfaction and passion which the cold affairs of marriage often lack. Because
Flower Room relationships are between people of different statuses -- old and
young, Dynast and patrician, Dynast and foreigner -- they are not viewed as a
threat to the marriage. Flower Room relationships are usually homosexual, and
thus unlikely to produce children; heterosexual dalliances are less frequent but
still common, and take advantage of the Realm's array of contraceptive
techniques to ensure that children are not conceived.

### The Stone Room

The _Stone Room_, sometimes called the _Cellar_, is the scandalous sphere of
relationships, used to describe those relationships which transcend the division
between public and private. Although the Stone Room is often controversial when
in adulthood, it is more commonly used to describe the youthful deviations or
_barely_ unacceptable circumstances the Dynasty often finds themselves in.

The prototypical Stone Room relationship is between secondary school mates,
often pledged to be married but indulging in one another. Such a relationship
intersects the public sphere, because it is between Dynasts of equal status, but
also the private sphere, because it is passionate and temporary. As such, it
dwells in the Stone Room. These relationships are tolerated, but those involved
are expected to grow past them.

Another relationship which is accepted as long as it ends is a relationship
between Dynasts in the legion; although often they are married, the nights are
long and Dynasts are horny, and so such pairs or even larger arrangements
naturally emerge. Once the legion returns home, it is expected that these
Stone Room relationships will end, and will not return unless they are shipped
out again.

Real controversy emerges when the Stone Room is not an excusable moment of
passion but a persistent affair. _Cheating_ really only exists when Stone Room
relationships are exposed in parallel to marriages, without the extenuating
circumstances that make such relationships tolerable.
