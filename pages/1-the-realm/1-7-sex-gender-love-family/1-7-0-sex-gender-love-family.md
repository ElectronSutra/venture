# Sex, Gender, Love, and Family

_The_ most important element of a Dynast's life is her family. Not only her
Great House, but also her immediately family: mothers, sisters, daughters,
cousins, and so forth. The family is everything to a Dynast -- after all, that
is what the Dynasty is named for.

The Realm is among the most enlightened societies in Creation when it comes to
matters of sex, family, and so forth. Arranged marriages are the norm and most
people understand that their marriage is a matter of family honor and decorum.
Every Dynast knows that her first and foremost duty is to continue the Dynasty
and ensure the continued legacy of the Dragon's Blood.
