# History

The Realm has been a coherent political entity for over seven centuries. During
that time, it has expanded under the Empress' rule from a single city-state to a
massive imperial and military power. All of Creation bends a knee to the Realm.

The history of the Realm begins with the [Realm Before](#ancient-history) and
the sacred uprising of the Dragon-Blooded under the Immaculate Dragons. After
the Dragons overthrew the devil-kings, their military structure gave rise to the
creation of the [Shogunate](/venture/the-realm/history/shogunate-period/).

The [Thousand Tragedies period](/venture/the-realm/history/thousand-tragedies-period)
marked the end of the Shogunate, brought about by the Unraveling which shook
Creation to its core. In RY -12, the Empress used the Sword of Creation to purge
the raksha and their wicked disease from the world, leading to the rise of the
[Seven Tigers](/venture/the-realm/history/seven-tigers-period). After twelve
years, she used the same Sword of Creation to destroy the Seven Tigers and
establish her own empire, which became known as the Realm.

The 1st to 3rd century of the Realm are known as the
[Unification Period](/venture/the-realm/history/unification-period/), during
which the Empress brought the whole Blessed Isle under her control. The 4th
through 7th centuries are generally known as the
[Spreading Dragon Wings period](/venture/the-realm/history/spreading-dragon-wings-period),
focused heavily on the Realm's expansion of satrapial holdings.

The discovery of Wu-Jian in the 690s, the dismantling of House Iselsi, the
elevation of House V'neef, and the sudden cultural changes of the early 700s
have lead some scholars to propose that this generation represents the start of
a new, as of yet, unnamed period, a "modern period" of abrupt changes.

## Ancient History

Humans have inhabited the Blessed Isle for as long as there has _been_ humanity
to inhabit it. In ancient times, the Isle was the seat of empires of many of the
devil-kings spoken of in the Immaculate Texts, and home to relics and splendors
lost to the modern age. This period is known as the _Realm Before_.

Relics and ruins of the Realm Before can be found throughout the Isle, and are
jealously and closely guarded by the Realm's ministries. Many of these ruins
contain powerful magic, inconceivable trickery, and ancient Artifacts -- all
valuable and restricted.
