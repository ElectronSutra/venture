# The Unification Period

The period between the founding of the Realm in RY 1 and the complete conquest
of the Blessed Isle under the Realm in RY 254 is called the _Unification_
_Period_. This period is characterized by frequent and continuous war, the birth
or prototyping of many of the Realm's contemporary practices including the
creation of the first Great Houses, and the rebuilding of society following the
devastation of the Thousand Sorrows and Seven Tigers periods.

The first century was a period of growth and healing, during which the Empress
committed many of her internal resources to establishing secure cities under her
rule. The propensity for state-building that she demonstrated during the first
century gained her powerful momentum that she carried through the next two
centuries to unite the Isle under her rule.

## Power Players

The Empress was not the only power on the rise during the period. A handful of
major competitor states are important to enumerate for a better comprehension of
the Unification Period.

### States of the Blessed Isle

In addition the Empress' nascent Realm, a handful of other government existed
on the Isle. Many of these traced their heritage back to the Shogunate period;
others arose during the Seven Tigers period as regional governments of
Tragedy survivors.

Of these governments, most were so unnoteworthy that they are not even
elaborated upon here; the following are significant enough that they deserve to
be addressed by name.

#### The Triumphate of Arjuf

The Triumphate of Arjuf was the Realm's greatest rival during the Unification
Period. Based in and around the city of Arjuf, the Triumphate was a military and
economic power that originated in the Shogunate period. The Triumphate was the
very first state to break away from the nominal power of the Shogun, but
retained the military dictatorship that characterized the Shogunate states.

The leader of Arjuf was the Triumphant, selected from the commanding generals of
Arjuf by the other generals. The Triumphant was a lifetime position, but was
expected to lead Arjuf's military endeavors and overseas conquests. Triumphants
tended not to last very long -- the best thing they could do for their legacy
was die honorably leading conquests in the name of their nation.

Arjuf held a huge swathe of land on the southern shores of the Isle, and their
territory only expanded when they began gobbling up now-vacant land during the
Seven Tigers period. Some neighboring states had already surrendered to Arjuf
during the Thousand Tragedies as the Triumphate expanded its reach. They also
maintained a couple coastal port holdings across the Strait of Arjuf, on the
Southshore Peninsula, which they had managed to defend against the incursions of
the Seven Tigers.

Arjuf's primary power was military, with a well-trained Legionnaire-style army
backed by their mercantile wealth. After the Thousand Tragedies period, Arjuf
expanded their economic reach, exploiting their Southshore holdings to mine
jade and silver from the mountains and trade with the See and the Immaculate
State.

#### The Harmonious Mountain State

The _Immaculate State_ is formally known as the Harmonious Mountain State, but
the prior name is used even in scholarly literature. The Immaculate State
traces its origins to the Vth century of the Shogunate, but was founded not in
accordance with the Shogun/Daimyo system, but instead as a theocratic coalition
of monasteries and temples high in the mountains of the Omphalos. At its peak,
it covered a staggering amount of sparsely-populated mountain land and commanded
a highly-respected military of pikemen and javelineers.

The Harmonious Mountain State was founded by the Twelve Legendary Masters, a
group of monks who had grown tired of the Shogunate's political landscape and
the ritualized combat of the interstate wars. They retreated into the mountains
and united several disparate mountain tribes under their leadership, and from
there established monasteries and cities in accordance with their sacred wisdom.

The Immaculate State was fully independent and recognized no higher authority;
even during the late Shogunate, it maintained that, as a religious community, it
did not fall under the martial governance of the daimyos or the shogun. After
the Unraveling and the Seven Tigers period, it quickly expanded to encapsulate
more mountains and natural resources. The State was lead by the
_Mouth of Peace_ and governed by the _Order_; the Empress would eventually
absorb these institutions into her own Realm. The capital of the State was at
the low-lying city of Juche.

The Harmonious Mountain State was famed for its huge, hearty people and its
sacred wisdom. They traded little with the outside, preferring where possible to
make due on their own; their population was always widespread and never large.
Their military was notable for their mountain fighting techniques, making use of
neither riding beasts nor chariots, and for their famous _Pasiap's Company_, the
highly-trained temple guards turned state's mercenaries which were a feared and
respected military unit by the fall of the Shogunate.

#### The See of Radimel

The _See of Radimel_ was a hereditary monarchy based on the island of Radimel's
Seat, dead south of the Blessed Isle. The See, and the island itself, are named
metonymously for the Seat of Radimel, a spectacular throne of lapis lazuli and
gold housed at the capital city, Port-of-Peace. The monarch of the See of
Radimel was called the Prince.

The See of Radimel had a strange position for most of its history, being neither
an allodial-state ruled by a daimyo nor a marcher-state sworn to a daimyo.
Instead, the Prince of Radimel swore loyalty directly to the Shogun, and had no
stake in the jade economy. The people of Radimel were traders of lesser things
like teas and fruits, and served as naval might -- which held little prestige
among the primarily land-war mindset of the Shogunate.

Consumate outsiders, the Radimeli declared independence from the Shogunate at
the end of the Vth century, when the position of Shogun was once again empty and
the Prince objected to the new Regent appointed in her place. After that,
Radimel supplemented income with oversea shipping services to the various
allodial-states, and occasional acts of privateering against ships passing
through their waters without paying.

#### Karashelen

_Karashelen_ was, for centuries, the western capital of the Shogunate, where
the Shogun would reside during certain months of the year. Following the
weakening of the position of Shogun, the city of Karashelen expanded as a gilt
cage for the Shogun. Beautiful, sparse, and fastidiously maintained, the city
was recognized as a holding of no daimyo but held directly by the Shogun.

After the Thousand Tragedies period, the city of Karashelen continued to
slowly decline. Although situated at a conflux of various trade routes, the
death of the last Shogun and the withdrawal of daimyo forces to their home
territories left Karashelen without the infrastructure to effectively collect
taxes and tariffs, stalling their economy.

Karashelen is today known as the city of _Lord's Crossing_, the seat of House
Tepet and capital of Lord's Crossing Dominion.

#### The Mercantile Federation

The _Mercantile Federation_ arose in the early RY 100s, as an alliance of a
handful of mercantile republics on the far Daoshin Peninsula. The capital of the
Federation was the stoney port city of Myion.

The Mercantile Federation lasted only a brief few decades before its conquest by
the Realm, and a brief resurgence during the coup of Manosque Viridian. At the
height of its power, the Federation had large pools of jade wealth which it was
able to use as leverage for security contracts with the many independent
mercenary companies that could be found on the Daoshin Peninsula, such as the
famous Red Company and the infamous Silver Knives.

#### Grand Cherak

#### The Seventh Legion of Lookshy

#### The Emirate of Jiara

#### The Empire of Gerath the Great

## RY 1: The Establishment of the Realm

The first year of the Realm was defined by the arrival of refugees and
petitioners from across the Isle. Thousands of hopefuls had seen the image of
the Empress in the sky, and made the trek across glass deserts, through beating
sour rain, and with little in their bellies, to reach her new Realm.

The Imperial Manse sits atop a raised spur of land, and does not have direct
access to the ocean. This proved, very quickly, to be an issue, requiring
arrivals by boat to trek upland to reach the promised home. In this manner, two
tent cities quickly arose: one on the water to receive petitioners, and another
up the spur where the Imperial Manse set, several hours trek inland. The merging
of these two tent cities was the first major step in the growth of the Realm.

Within just a handful of years, the land around the Imperial Manse had
transformed from forested wilderness to cleared grassland, and then to the
beginnings of urban sprawl. Docks were built, and then expanded, allowing for
movement of people and goods by the ocean. Stone quarries popped up to fuel the
need for building material. Upriver, new merchant clans arose, getting rich on
the river clay for forming bricks and river soil for building new farms.

By all accounts, the development of the Imperial City from nothing to one of the
most powerful urban areas in the world was among the fastest in human history.
The recognizeable Inner City of the modern era was apparent in a mostly-finished
state within two decades.

## RY 3: The Integration of the Xianyu Peninsula

The Empress is WÃ n, descended from the chocobo-riding, red-haired people of the
Xianyu Peninsula. During the first few years recovering from the apocalypse, the
Xianyu Princes warred among themselves, competing for what scarce resources they
could get their hands on.

The Empress began her conquest of the Xianyu Peninsula by integrating the
wandering, post-apocalyptic people on the opposite bank of the river from the
Imperial City. She offered them protection and government in exchange for their
riding skill and service. By these means, she quickly amassed a respectable
army of riders to assist in her plans for her homeland.

The Empress offered a simple decision to the Xianyu Princes: submit, or be
overrun. Many Princes, awed by her beauty, charisma, and miraculous
apparation, swore fealty to her on principle as a Shogunate officer, or out of
admiration for her growing strength. Others resisted her authority, and these
were answered with her Dragon-Blooded followers and the cavalry of the southern
river shore. After a few conclusive victories lead by the Empress herself, all
the surviving Xianyu Princes swore loyalty to her, and the peninsula was hers.

The Realm at this point started to face shortages of material goods; the Xianyu
Peninsula's crops and resources had been decimated in the Thousand Tragedies
just a decade ago, and stores of rice had yet to be recovered. The Empress
used her magic and her Dragon-Blooded followers to inspire verdant growth in the
fields. Even with these boons, it quickly became clear that her young state
needed more than it could produce with the resources it had.

The Realm may well have ended here, dying of shortages as so many post-Tragedy
states did, were it not for the surprising influx of jade that arrived at the
Empress' door one morning. A strange crystaline creature, bearing carts of jade,
had descended from the mountains and come to offer her tribute. The Empress
swiftly learned that the Mountain Folk, those inscrutable and inhuman
dwellers-beneath-the-mountains, had sworn her fealty and were prepared to offer
her annual tribute as their new leader, as long as she left them alone to tend
their own affairs.

The influx of staggering amounts of jade -- far more than the coffers of
competing states -- gave the Empress the momentum she needed to overcome the
initial hurdles of infrastructure. She was able to make generous payments to
talented craftsmen who had survived the Thousand Tragedies, who helped her
nation construct infrastructure; she was able to pay mercenary bandits to serve
her as state force; she was able to pay sorcerers and bribe divinities for
fertility, health, and good harvests.

## RY 15: The Luo-Han Subjugation

The Luo-Han Plains are known today as a beautiful and tranquil place of farmland
and respite, a temperate and pleasant retreat for those who want a more quiet
life. This is in stark contrast to the Plains in the early first century: a
dry and cracked expanse, torn with many rifts leaking strange mystical energy,
and populated by horse-riding tribes of warriors.

The Luo-Han was home to several distinct bands of riding peoples, focused on the
tradition of horses. During the Late Shogunate, these peoples had been divided
between riding and settled branches, but the chaos of the Thousand Troubles had
forced many of the settled citizens to take up riding once again. They thus
formed a widespread and low density population which could do little to stop
the nascent Realm from simply gobbling up land.

Though the Luo-Han could do little to stop the Realm from taking their land,
they did much to stop the Realm from taking their people. The riders were unable
to hold land against the Empress, but retaliated with raids and nighttime
slaughters. The Empress used a combination of Legions, bribes, and remnant
Shogunate authority to gradually cow the Luo-Han people across fifteen years of
conflict.

By RY 15, the Empress had subjugated enough of the Luo-Han people that she was
able to begin stamping out the rebellious riders and begin extracting tribute.
Her bargain was simple: she offered magic, crops, and jade in exchange for their
servitude, promising to seal the cracks and restore the Luo-Han Plains to their
former verdancy in exchange for loyalty. The people listened to their stomachs.

## RY 20: Araka Jeresh

The man called Araka Jeresh, more formally Heron XIX, ruled Arjuf as Heron XIX
through the Seven Tigers period and into the Empress' rule. A man equally as
capable as he was arrogant, he was an archetypal Triumphant: loud, proud, good
with a sword, and roguishly handsome.

In the early years of the Realm, Araka Jeresh sent a courier to the nascent
Realm, offering to share the weight of the crown equally with the Empress. She
captured the courier, putting him to use in her service, and sent a sorcerous
message to Araka Jeresh. The story goes that her apparition awoke him in the
night, where she spied him disheveled and naked; she recited a poem which
compared him unfavorably to the scraggly, preening moa which roam the Arjufi
countryside. She then used her magic to call down green fire that reduced his
hunting palace to ash. The story continues that it was that night, as he stood
shivering and naked staring at the remnants of his retreat, that Araka Jeresh
knew real love for the first time.

Araka Jeresh has a reputation in history as a vain and foppish man embodying
many of the worst male traits -- erotic fixation, emotional instability,
violent overreaction -- which is certainly deserved. However, his secondary
reputation, as an insightful commander and talented leader, is likewise
deserved. A Wood Aspect through and through, Jeresh was, by all accounts, an
excellent judge of potential, and quickly recognized that the Empress was not
someone to trifle with.

After his palace was burned, Jeresh traveled in person over seas, braving
Radimeli pirates and stormy winter waters, to speak to the Empress in person.
He offered an alliance, genuine this time, with a shared goal: pushing the See
of Radimel from its holdings on the mainland, which he knew would obstruct the
Empress' expansion and which troubled his own attempts at establishing trade
with the cities rebuilding themselves on the southeastern edge of the Isle.

The Empress accepted, and took him as a lover. In RY 21, he sired the Empress'
first daughter, Jerah, who would become one of the first matriarchs in the
Realm.
