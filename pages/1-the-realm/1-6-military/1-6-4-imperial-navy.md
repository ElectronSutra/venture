# The Imperial Navy

## The Imperial Navy

The Imperial Navy is the Realm's military presence on the water. The Navy and
House Peleps are synonymous; House Peleps is solely responsible for the
administration of the naval forces. The Imperial Navy consists of thousands of
ships spread across the Inland Sea and the Great Western Ocean and employs a
staggering number of sailors, marines, and support staff.

### Her Radiance's Charter of the Imperial Navy

The Empress' formal charter of the Navy outlines its primary duties and general
structure. She tasks the Navy with three main tasks: to secure the Realm's
waters from enemies foreign and domestic; to guarantee the safe and effective
traversal of the waters by official ships; and to expand the Realm's holdings by
conquest of overseas territories.

The service of the Navy is an expansive task, which the Empress assigns
exclusively to House Peleps. In support of House Peleps, the Empress' ministries
contain a few organizations tasked with Imperial oversight of the Navy, such
as auditing ledgers and coordinating naval escorts of high-value Imperial
interests. Overall, House Peleps is allowed incredible leeway when it comes to
running the Navy, as long as they pay their sailors, protect the targets they
have to protect, and keep the pirates under control.

### Organization and Administrative Structure of the Imperial Navy

#### The Rightly Guided Admiralty Board

The commanding body of the Imperial Navy is the Rightly Guided Admiralty Board,
headed by the First Sea Lady. The Admiralty Board is composed of a dozen or so
of the Navy's most experienced and respected admirals, who collectively set the
policy and engagements of the Imperial Navy. The Board meets in total twice a
year at the Isle of Wrack, once in the winter and once in the summer. For the
rest of the year, the Ladies Nautical of the Board operate independently or in
committee on specialized aspects of the Navy.

Like much of the Navy, the reality of the Board and its theory diverge.
Technically, any admiral of any sex, background, or House is eligible to serve
on the Admiralty Board. In reality, the positions on the Board are reserved
almost exclusively for female Dragon-Blooded natural-born Peleps. Likewise, the
First Sea Lady is technically elected by the Board from any of its members --
but in practice, the First Sea Lady is the heir daughter of the Peleps
matriarch.

#### The Ladies Nautical

In addition to the _First Sea Lady_ -- the highest officer in the Navy and
direct report to the Empress herself -- the Ladies Nautical of the Board are
assigned specific authorities in the details of running the Navy.

The _Second Sea Lady_ is the second authority after the First Sea Lady, and
usually responsible for running the Admiralty while the First Sea Lady is away
at the Imperial City to answer to the Empress. In many respects, the Second Sea
Lady is more directly relevant to the life of an average sailor, since she
usually administers a greater fraction of the daily operations of the Navy. In
addition to these obligations, the Second Sea Lady also administers the Navy's
personnel, and directs the Navy's plans for mobilizing and crewing the various
ships.

The _Third Sea Lady_ is also known as the _Respected Comptroller of the Navy_,
or simply the _Comptroller_. In addition to serving as comptroller -- auditing
the books for profit and loss and ensuring that payroll and expenses are within
operating boundaries -- she also oversees the Navy's production: shipbuilding,
ship repairs, and producing materiel are all under the authority of the
Comptroller.

The _Fourth Sea Lady_ is also titled the _Rightly Honored Chief Quartermaster_
_of Ship and Shore_; in conversation, the Fourth Sea Lady is usually just called
the _Chief 'Master_. Her department, the _Supply Office_, is responsible for the
Navy's logistics and purchasing. The Supply Office makes sure that all of the
Navy's soldiers receive their food and water, that new sails arrive to port in
time, etc.
