# Theater

The Blessed Isle is home to many theatrical traditions, from the puppets of
the northwest to the dancing folk heroes of the Pendant Isles. A few of
these traditions are venerable old traditions, others charming novelties, and
yet others, the indulgence of the bloodthirsty peasantry.

## Respectable Theater

The Realm's worthy and respectable traditions trace their origin back to the
Shogunate, and are grounded in traditional performances of old plays. They are
highly formalized and require many decades to master. These widespread theaters
can be found in all major cities of the Isle, and their forms are recognized by
most of the Isle's urban population to some extent or another.

Actors who focus on the respectable traditions are, of course, worthy of praise;
they are actively cultivating the Realm's refined heritage. The theater is one
of the places where patricians can most readily earn respect from the Dynasty;
some famous Dynast-patrician marriages have involved an acclaimed and respected
Patrician actor.

### Wàn Theater

_Wàn theater_ emerges from the northeast, in the lands of Pangu and the Imperial
River valley. It is descended from the Shogunate's theatrical traditions, which
in turn trace _their_ heritage to the old capital of Karashelen. Wàn theater is
a treasured part of Wàn cultural heritage and a common fixture of Dynastic
going-out entertainment.

Wàn theater is characterized by its elaborate costuming and masks. All actors
wear a flat mask while performing, the color of which indicates the role of the
character: the five elemental colors ususally denote protagonists, or, when
paired with a devious mustache or comical eyebrows, a particularly potent
villain. Masks in other colors indicate roles like tricksters, teachers, and
heretics. Actors dress in incredibly elaborate Wàn garb; the lead female
character often wears seven or eight layers of clothing, and costumes can weigh
in excess of 50 pounds in the most elaborate productions.

Wàn theater uses no scenery, and actors only carry weapons or instruments as
props. The performance is extremely physical, with an emphasis on positioning,
posing, and communicating to the audience through body language. The combination
of hot theater, heavy costumes, restricted breathing from the mask, and intense
physical focus makes performing Wàn theater a truly exhausting act.

Wàn theatrical productions tend toward longer form performances driven by
character acting; a truly spectacular Wàn performance is one in which the actor
most fully embodies the character and their role in the story. The Wàn
theatrical canon draws heavily from the _Epics_ of the Immaculate tradition, the
records of the early days of the Realm, and famous historical Shogunate battles
and political kerfuffles. Wàn productions usually include at least one fight
scene, and at least one monologue from the leading actor. The plays focus on the
ability of the actor, their physical presence, and the narrative driving the
production.

The stage for Wàn theater is generally a large rectangular platform featuring
four pillars -- red, green, black, and blue -- and a white banner at the
entrance of the hall to welcome guests inside. Theatrical texts discuss how this
parallels Creation, and empowers stories by drawing the attention of not only
the human, but the supernatural as well.

### Qián Theater

_Qián_ theater descends from the same Shogunate tradition as Wàn theater, but
evolved to focus more heavily on the excellent performance of a small canon of
distinguished plays, rather than the individual actor focus of Wàn theater. A
well-staged production in the Qián school focuses on bringing to the stage a
clear realization of the canon. In a perfectly realized Qián production, the
audience should leave the theater and be stunned that they emerge into the
modern world rather than into the historical world of the plays.

Like Wàn theater, Qián theater makes extensive use of elaborate costuming, and
foresakes the use of scenery and props in favor of the actor's individual skill.
However, where the Wàn theater emphasizes the actor bringing their own spin on
the character and allows for improvisation, the Qián theater is focused on the
immaculate realization of the detailed plays -- not only the lines in the
script, but also the stage instructions and other elements hidden to the
audience. The books and opinions which underly the theory of Qián theater
include lists of hundreds of mudras for the actors to perform, many different
ways to hold one's shoulders or cast one's gaze, and all such detailed
instructions must be executed flawlessly for a successful performance.

Productions in the Qián theater are typically 30 to 45 minutes in length,
consisting of a small number of scenes featuring a small number of actors. A
night of performance includes a run of several of these shorter plays. The run
features Five Topics:

1. An historical event or an excerpt of a famous battle;
2. Nature and humanity's place in nature;
3. The Perfected Hierarchy;
4. Family and duty to family;
5. Spirits and gods.

The plays in a run also feature at least one of each of the Three Moods:

1. Mournful;
2. Comedic;
3. Erotic.

Playwrights emphasize that this combination of Five Topics and Three Moods
evokes a broad experience of the human condition. Many authors in the Qián canon
establish their style by their takes on the combinations -- where one author may
interpret Family/Erotic as an epic of courtly love, another may interpret it as
a steamy trist between forbidden lovers and the consequences of their actions.

The Qián canon features a handful of plays in each combination from roughly a
dozen authors, including Tepet Zao Kuyen, the master of comedy, and Lotus, the
Old Master, hailing from a House whose name was struck from the ledgers but
whose masterful erotic and nature plays remain a touchstone of the Qián
tradition today.

Qián plays are usually staged in a smaller and more intimate theater, to better
allow the audience to be up close and admire the performance's technical
aspects. Qián plays naturally give rise to a dialect of tropes and references
that occasionally make their way into the wider Dynasty. Outsiders, or newcomers
to the Dynasty, may find themselves the excluded party after a _refined_
Dynast makes reference to one of Lotus' more obscure works with a quote or a
certain flutter of the eyebrows.

## Eclectic Theater

Further toward the edges of society than the respectable Wàn and Qián
traditions, the Isle is also home to many local theaterical heritages that have
their own expectations and rituals. Although none of these have the same
prestige or standing as the respectable theaters, they are often beloved by the
peasantry and an important relic of the local culture.
