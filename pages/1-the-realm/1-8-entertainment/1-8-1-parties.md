# Parties

Life in the Dynasty, especially while on the Isle and away from one's duties, is
an endless cascade of parties and social events. No matter where you go, if
there is a Dynastic presence, there is a party to be found. The Dynasty usually
talks about parties in four broad categories: _visits_, _salons_,
_celebrations_, and _galas_. These categories are descriptive, not a formal
categorization. Generically, parties can be called _parties_ or _soirées_.

## Politeness

Parties are the glue that holds Dynastic society together, and so have developed
a rather rigid system of politeness regarding invitations, behavior, and
attendance.

### Invitations

> Honored Minister,
>
> I am organizing a recitation of local poetry on the 7 Descending Fire, and
> would be honored if you were to attend. My household eagerly awaits your
> presence.
>
> -- Mnemon Lily

Decorum dictates that everyone who's anyone in the area gets invited to big
events. The expectation does not align to reality -- often, "invitations" are
"delivered late," or even "lost" altogether. Further, it is well understood that
not every invitation is meant to be honored. Most Dynasts know that the slips of
paper arriving at their doorstep are not genuine.

> Honored Prince,
>
> Regrettably, my obligations in the ministry preclude my attendance on the 7th.
> I am saddened that I am unable to attend. I wish you good fortune in my
> absence.
>
> -- Cathak Lo-Gwen

Refusing an invitation likewise has decorum. Of course, no Dynast would ever
refuse to attend an event simply because they _didn't want to_, oh no no. There
is always a convenient excuse -- a conflicting duty, a matter that needs
attending to, which prevents attending the event.

> Senator Nellens Stone,
>
> I deeply regret that it appears my servants were unable to deliver you an
> invitation to the poetry recitation I had organized yesterday, the 7th
> Descending Fire. I will diligently ensure that such an error does not happen
> again.
>
> -- Mnemon Lily

In summary: Everyone is invited -- except when they aren't -- and very few
accept -- except when they do.

### Behavior

Dynastic parties maintain a façade of propriety, no matter the reality.
_Causing a scene_ is perhaps the most detestable thing one can do at a soirée.
After all, when all eyes are on you, rumors spread quickly when you mess up. In
this way, even the raunchest, most gin-soaked parties present themselves as
something respectable.

Brawling, drunken escapades, and other incidents are private affairs, to be
dealt with outside or behind closed doors. Everyone expects that such things
will occasionally happen, and the societal expectation is a great degree of
discretion. Dynasts who make themselves known as rowdy guests will quickly find
themselves with many lost invitations or last-minute reschedulings. Even Cynis,
notorious hedonists, keep their indiscretions to back rooms.

There are exceptions, of course -- orgies, drug parties, kinky sex clubs. These
affairs are far more discrete than the standard parties. The secretive nature of
these events is enough to ensure the discretion of those present -- the public
scandal of being exposed is leverage to keep things quiet.

Lastly, the matter of business. Discussing work is usually uncouth at parties,
which are celebratory and leisurely. Nearly every party, though, is a front for
some kind of business -- a backroom deal, a handshake agreement, an exchange of
favors. Such business is to be kept out of the limelight.

### Departure

Departing from a party without bidding farewell to the host is extremely rude.
To leave a party early, you must come up with some kind of excuse -- a pressing
affair which calls for your attention, and regretfully inform the host that you
must depart. Decorum demands that she offer her resources and people as a
solution, but such offers are polite formality.

At the end of the party, the host will announce final toasts and invite those in
attendance to stay longer and partake of more food, drink, and music. The offer
is made generally to those in attendance, but intended only for a few -- the
guests who are intended to stay will know who they are well in advance.

The afterparty is either a quieter affair with indulgences like fancy desserts,
expensive liquors, and private performances, or a raucous affair with a smaller
group of close friends. Either way, the after-party is generally expected to
last well into the early morning, and the host will make beds, pajamas, and such
available to her guests.

In the morning, the host will make a final offer for tea, breakfast, and an
extended stay. Tea and breakfast are usually genuine offers -- but the extended
stay is, again, a formality which the guest is not expected to accept.

## Visits

There is plenty of business that is best addressed through a face-to-face
meeting. And of course, sometimes you just want to go visit an old friend or a
cousin you are fond of. _Visits_ are the simple, informal affairs when one
Dynast goes to stay with another. Impromptu visits are frowned upon, but plenty
of legitimate reasons exist for such. In general, it is expected that you will
at least give your host a few days notice to prepare.

Hospitality is an important virtue in the Realm, so hosts are expected to
provide meals, lodging, and essentials for their guests with no expectation of
repayment or strings attached. Generally, the visitor is expected to bring a
gift of some kind, as a show of gratitude to the host. Only especially egregious
violations of hospitality -- such as staying far past what would be reasonable,
or abusing the host's resources -- would be a reason to break the hospitality
customs; even then, the host will usually frame it as a regrettable circumstance
that prevents them from hosting their guest any longer.

The mornings and afternoons of a visit are filled with leisure and enjoying
(hopefully) one another's company. Business _only_ takes place after dinner,
usually in a private study or such. Truly pressing business, like deaths in the
family or immediate political matters, may require business before dinner.

## Salons

A step up from informal visits, a _salon_ is a minimally-formal gathering of
invited guests. Salons are usually arranged by a specific host for a specific
event -- such as a poetry recitation, a concert, a recounting of war stories, or
the death day anniversary of a departed friend. Salons can run from a single
evening to several days, with the focus on providing ample time for the guests
to relax, mingle, and engage in the party's function.

Decorum requires that salon invitations be extended to some guests, even though
their attendance is neither required nor desired. These invitations operate on
an unspoken assumption and informal understanding. Deeply private occasions,
like death day anniversaries or a reunion of friends, are generally exempt from
the expectation to invite outsiders. Niche occasions, like card tournaments or
poetry competitions, might send widespread invitations for attendance --
understanding that most will not be honored -- but very specific invitations for
participation.

Salons are often an occasion for a more relaxed socializing among the elite.
Small salons are an opportunity to get away from the public eye and spend some
time among the elite, where things can be more intimate and cultured. In salons
more than anywhere else, the unspoken proscriptions of mixing business and
leisure hold sway -- salon business is strictly backroom.

## Galas

_Galas_ are the peak of the Dynasty's party scene. Galas are a massive show of
conspicuous consumption, featuring the most gorgeous outfits (worn once and then
thrown away), the most respected musicians, and the grandest feasts. They begin
very early and end very, very late -- often days later. These events always
include many speeches, toasts, and celebrations.

Galas are called for many different occasions, and decorum dictates that all
Dynasts in the region be invited -- and unlike the many kinds of invitations
which are expected to be turned down, gala invitations are usually accepted.
Everybody loves galas, and generally, the more people the better, since one of
the primary functions of a gala is to hobknob and socialize among the elites.
The most undesireable guests will often find galas scheduled during their
voyages abroad or their invitations "lost" by feckless couriers.

Two of the most common galas are birthday galas and wedding galas. Birthdays are
always an occasion for a big party; and each household usually has an annual
birthday gala on which they celebrate the birthday of all the children in the
household who have yet to come of age, during the first month of the year.
Weddings are also enormous affairs, featuring the best that both families
involved can muster -- and the most respected and honorable presiding judge and
most esteemed monk that they can get.

## Celebrations

_Celebrations_ are the public festivals of the Immaculate Calendar, open to
everyone in the local community, including the lower classes. These often
feature parades, public services, and the like. Celebrations of course call for
fancy clothes and solemn respect, but not for the same decadent luxury as proper
parties.

Dynastic children often dread celebrations, where they must sit quietly, cannot
figet, and observe a long, boring sermon. Adult Dynasts often dread holidays for
the close scrutiny they will be under from patricians and peasants; during a
holiday celebration in the public eye, the Dynasty must always present its most
favorable face. The food and celebrations are fun, though.
