# Entertainment

Life in the Dynasty is the most prosperous and luxurious life in all of
Creation. The Princes of the Earth enjoy a wide variety of entertainments,
ranging from the endless cavalcade of parties, to theatrical performances, to
retained musicians, to sports and games. A Dynast is presented with endless ways
to wile away their time atop the world.

For peasants, the options are more limited, but the human desire for
entertainment leads to many outlets. Although the day's labor is hard, the
evening brings family and relaxation in preparation for the work ahead.
