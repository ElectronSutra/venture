# House Tepet

## The Air Stained By the Blood of Legions

![Tepet Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/tepet.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

Before the Realm there was the Shogunate, the divided period of warring
Dragon-Blooded states, and in the Shogunate there were many competing Shoguns,
the great leaders of these states. Among them was the Shogun Tepet, the
warrior-poet heir to a kingdom on the Blessed Isle. He took up arms against the
Empress and laid siege to her for a year and a day before he conceded; at the
end of his defeat, he bowed before the Empress and offered her his head if she
would spare his soldiers. Instead, she married him, and raised a Great House in
his honor.

House Tepet is the oldest Great House, the very first to be elevated. They have
cultivated their relationship to their ancient traditions. No other House is as
devoted to their roots. Only Cathak rivals the glory of the Tepet Legions, and
only Peleps rivals their heroism and romantic reputation.

**WARNING**. In RY 675, House Tepet is devastated in the Battle of Futile Blood
and reduced to a mockery of itself, struggling to recover from the loss of a
full quarter of its membership in a failed campaign in the North. This _will_ be
during the course of our story.

## Why Play a Tepet?

House Tepet is all about _heritage_. They are the heirs of an ancient tradition
and code that is older than the Realm itself, and expect and demand that this
tradition be respected. In the modern era, House Tepet is about _failure_. They
are devastated by a crippling loss and must fight tooth-and-claw to survive
without being devoured by their rivals.

Play a Tepet if you want to inherit the bushido of an ancient society; if you
want to be a _divine armiger_ or a _yamabushi spirit-scout_; if you want to play
someone whose family and life is devastated in a massive event beyond their
control; or if you want to examine the relationship between your personal creed
and the goals of your House.

## What Do You Know?

Tepet characters have an increased awareness of the following topics:

- You have a broad knowledge of politics in the Tepet holdings. You can name all
  the major players, their duties, and their allegiances. Likewise, you can name
  the leaders of the Legions and their great acts.
- Your childhood lessons focused on the ancient traditions of your House, and
  emphasized the importance of heritage. You have a broad knowledge of history,
  and can name the important figures, rebellions, and techniques of the Realm's
  history.
- You have trained from the time you could walk to inherit the Tepet forms and
  martial wisdom. You know the names, functions, and use of all weapons that are
  common in the Realm. You have studied several; **describe** your fighting
  style by giving it a name like Seven Reeds Sword or Ascending Phoenix Knife.
- All Tepet adults have a _swearing ceremony_ when they receive their adult
  name. In this ceremony, they swear fealty to a Code: either to the Tepet
  Creed, or to any other code they choose. You know all the major codes and
  myths that inform Tepet culture. What is _your_ code?
