# House Sesus

## The Fire That Makes the Shadow Strong

![Sesus Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/sesus.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

The _Thousand Correct Actions_ states, "all warfare is based on deception," and
no House so fully embraces that truth as House Sesus. From their home in the
rainy frozen streets of Chanos, Sesus rules an empire of thugs, brutes, and
cruel enforcers. One of the three Houses permitted to retain their Legions, the
Sesus Legions lack the honor of House Cathak or the tradition of House Tepet,
focused instead on subterfuge and spycraft. House Sesus has a reputation for
duplicity, cruelty, and blasphemy.

Anyone who knows anything about politics knows to keep an eye out for House
Sesus. Their network of spies and informants reaches to every corner of the
Isle; their payroll includes thugs and enforcers in every city. Although no one
trusts House Sesus, their strong blood, extensive military, and huge satrapial
economy mean that every House marries into Sesus -- and those who do often come
to believe that House Sesus is perhaps not so bad as their reputation suggests.

## Why Play a Sesus?

House Sesus is all about _force_. They are masterful manipulators, unrepentent
thugs, and dangerous to know -- and thus, exciting. You should play a Sesus if
you are interested in having a horrible reputation; if you want to play a master
assassin or excellent spy; or if you want to examine the relationship between
your House's well-deserved reputation and your own goals and desires.

## Sesus Culture

House Sesus values cleverness and cold, calculating efficiency. They believe
that the ends justify the means, so all means are acceptable for the ends of
increasing the House's power. The heroic, stupid, and honest are taken to serve
as the House's public facade; the devious and clever are put to use in thuggery
and espionage. House Sesus has one of the strongest bloodlines in the Realm,
which makes them incredibly strategic about their marriages. They do not accept
marriage proposals for thin-bloods or foreigners except under exceptional
circumstances.

## What Do You Know?

Sesus characters have a greater awareness of the following topics:

- You have a deep awareness of politics in the Sesus holdings. You know the
  names, faces, positions, and allegiances of major and minor figures, and the
  vague plots that are likely afoot.
- Your childhood lessons emphasized the power of knowledge and surveillance. You
  know all the important figures of the other Great Houses, along with their
  duties and allegiances.
- You grew up training for your service to the House. You know the basics of
  formations and command. You know the essentials of spycraft and assassination,
  such as basic techniques for quickly dispatching a woman. You understand the
  mechanics of sabotage and how to identify a priority target and case a joint.
- You have an instinct for beauty in the written form. You know how to create
  beautiful calligraphy and compose poems in a variety of styles. You know the
  basics of how to draw and are a better sketch artist than most.
