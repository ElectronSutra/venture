# House Peleps

## The Water That Wreathes the Crown of Centuries

![Peleps Mon](./../../../assets/house_mons/peleps.png){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px"}

A dashing sea captain strides confidently across her ship, broadsword in hand,
to challenge the pirates that threaten the Isle. A dark-eyed judge presides,
absolute and incorruptible, over a trial, searching for the Truth. A daring
adventurer surfaces from the jetsam of a sinking ship, a crewmate under each
arm sputtering for air, before she dives back down to save more of her fellows.

This is House Peleps. As famous for their reputation as their monopoly on the
Imperial Navy, House Peleps is the oldest, most romatic, and most heroic House
in the Realm (if you ask them...).

Everyone knows that Peleps is a bastion of honor, glory, and tradition. They
produce the best admirals, the fairest judges, the greatest adventurers -- and
no one mentions how their failures seem to gently disappear from the public eye
as soon as they fuck up. Peleps makes no room for failures. Their heroic and
romantic reputation is carefully cultivated, and every failure trimmed from the
House like an errant branch of a bonsai.

## Why Play a Peleps?

House Peleps is all about _expectation_. As a child, every Peleps is demanded to
succeed. Failure will not be forgiven; only the best may call themselves Peleps.
Play a Peleps if you want to hail from a House with a unique niche; if you want
to be defined by honor, heroism, and a ruthless pursuit of perfection; or if you
want to explore the conflict between your House's draconian expectations and
your own personal failings.

## Peleps Culture

Success cannot be bought in House Peleps, and failure is never forgiven. Peleps
refer to luck as "the trade winds" in their sayings; they attribute good luck to
good morals, so good luck is always earned, and bad luck always a sign of
failure. House Peleps is very firmly entrenched in traditional gender roles,
with no notable male leadership figures of note.
