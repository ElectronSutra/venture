# Social Defenses

You have two primary social defense stats: Resolve and Guile.

## Resolve

Your Resolve is your ability to resist being persuaded. Your Resolve is equal to
([Wits + Integrity] / 2, round up).

## Guile

Your Gile is your poker face. Mostly you use it to resist
[Read Intentions](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#read-intentions)
or similar effects. Your Guile is equal to ([Manipulation + Socialize] / 2,
round up).

## Rejecting Influence

If your Resolve is overcome, you still have a final opportunity to resist being
persuaded. You may spend Willpower to reject influence.

### Rejecting Instill and Inspire

You may spend 1wp to automatically resist any
[Instill](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#instill) or
[Inspire](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#inspire) action.

### Decision Points

If you resist a
[Persuade](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#persuade),
[Bargain](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#bargain),
or [Threaten](/venture/systems/social-influence/social-actions#threaten) action,
you enter a _decision point_.

In a decision point, you must cite a _second_, _equally strong or stronger_
Intimacy as the one used as leverage in order to resist. So if you were
Persuaded through a Major Intimacy, you must cite a _different_ Major or
Defining Intimacy in order to reject the influence.

If you are able to cite such an Intimacy, you spend 1wp and reject the
influence.

If you are unable to cite such an Intimacy, you may not reject and you have to
go along with what you've been persuaded.

## Unacceptable Influence

The last and final protection is that some influence is just straight-up
_unacceptable_. Here are some examples:

- An Instill action without sufficient evidence;
- A Persuade action without sufficient leverage;
- Influence that the person believes would lead to death or suicide;
- A seduction attempt that defies the target's sexuality;
- etc.

You automatically resist unacceptable influence -- it just doesn't work.
