# The Bitter Art of Medicine

Medicine is an odd one. It tends not to be super relevant unless someone has
chosen to specialize in it. Here's how it works.

## Being a Doctor

### Treating Wounds

You can staunch someone who is dying by rolling (Intelligence + Medicine) versus
(their Wound Penalty, max 5). If you succeed, they stabilize and fall
unconscious, allowing you to get them away.

Some magic can patch wounds and heal broken bones.

### Treating Disease

#### Diagnosis

Roll with Medicine to diagnose your patient based on their symptoms. If you
fail, you simply don't know; only a botch will result in an absolutely
incorrect diagnosis.

If you don't know what disease you are treating, increase the difficulty of your
course of treatment by +2 to +4 depending on the rarity and severity of the
disease.

#### Course of Treatment

Treating a [disease](/venture/systems/medicine/diseases) uses Medicine and
requires about an hour per day per victim treated. After your course of
treatment is completed, roll (Intelligence + Medicine). When the patient makes
their next check against the disease, they can use your result or theirs,
whichever is higher.

### Treating Poison

Roll with Medicine to treat a poison, as long as you have an antivenom or
emetic on hand. Every threshold success you get counts as a bonus success for
the patient's roll to resist that poison.

### Battlefield Medicine

Add 2 to the difficulty of any diagnosis or poison treatment roll made while in
an active combat situation.

## The Aesthetics of Medicine

Medicine is weird because we, as modern Americans, casually happen to know a lot
more about disease and illness than most historical doctors ever did. Germ
theory is very recent, after all.

So in Creation, all sorts of different medicines work at the same time. You can
genuinely treat a lot of diseases using acupuncture, tai chi, and other courses
of alternative medicine.

Germs and diseases run on narrative. You won't get screwed over because you
forgot to sanitize a knife -- unless you think that is cool. If you make a
character that is good at medicine, you should figure out what kind of aesthetic
you are going for and stick to it.
