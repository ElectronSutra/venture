# The Bitter Art of Medicine

Medicine is an odd one. It tends not to be super relevant unless someone has
chosen to specialize in it. Here's how it works.

## Being a Doctor

### Treating Wounds

You can staunch someone who is dying by rolling (Intelligence + Medicine) versus
(their Wound Penalty, max 5). If you succeed, they stabilize and fall
unconscious, allowing you to get them away.

Some magic can patch wounds and heal broken bones.

### Treating Disease

#### Diagnosis

Roll with Medicine to diagnose your patient based on their symptoms. If you
fail, you simply don't know; only a botch will result in an absolutely
incorrect diagnosis.

If you don't know what disease you are treating, increase the difficulty of your
course of treatment by +2 to +4 depending on the rarity and severity of the
disease.

#### Course of Treatment

Treating a [disease](/venture/systems/medicine/diseases) uses Medicine and
requires about an hour per day per victim treated. After your course of
treatment is completed, roll (Intelligence + Medicine). When the patient makes
their next check against the disease, they can use your result or theirs,
whichever is higher.

### Treating Poison

Roll with Medicine to treat a poison, as long as you have an antivenom or
emetic on hand. Every threshold success you get counts as a bonus success for
the patient's roll to resist that poison.

### Battlefield Medicine

Add 2 to the difficulty of any diagnosis or poison treatment roll made while in
an active combat situation.
