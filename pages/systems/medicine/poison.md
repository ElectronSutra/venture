# Poisons

## Poison Stats

Poisons have four major stats: damage/interval, duration, penalty, and vector.

### Damage per Interval

Damage/interval is how much damage the poison does, and how frequently it does
it.

### Duration

Duration describes how long the poison persists.

### Penalty

Penalty represents the penalty assessed to all actions while suffering from the
poison.

### Vector

Vector represents the means of contracting the poison; usually the vector is
something like "damage" or "ingestion."

## Poison Process

When you are first exposed to the poison, roll (Stamina + Resistance). Every
success on the roll reduces the poison's duration by 1 unit.

The Chosen can completely reduce a poison, suffering no consequences. Mortals
can reduce it to, at most, half the normal duration.

Every interval, roll the damage and take the result.

### Multiple Doses

If you suffer from multiple doses of the same poison, the durations stack. New
doses will add to the duration of any doses you are currently suffering.

## Example Poisons

**Red Snake Venom**: Damage 2i/round (L in Crash); duration: 3 rounds; penalty:
-3; vector: damage.

**Arsenic**: Damage 2L/day; duration: 7 days; penalty: -0; vector: ingestion.
