# Aesthetics of Medicine

Medicine in _Exalted_ and in the Realm specifically does not have to, nor
necessarily _should_, mirror the contemporary understanding of medicine.

There are no germs or viruses in Creation -- or if there are, they aren't known
and no one cares. No, you see, disease is much simpler than that: your qi is
out of line, you've been cursed by a ghost, that sort of thing.

Medicine in _Exalted_ works because it is cool. Set aside all your understanding
of real-world medicine, and embrace the fantastical.

This isn't clinical medicine -- this is a world of _physick_ and _chirurgy_.

***

A natural inspiration for treatment in the Realm is TCM, Traditional Chinese
Medicine. Let's say you chose this is your aesthetic; you might then assemble
the following list of treatments that you will use during the game.

## Anatomy of Illness

The body has several _meridians_, lines of vital energy that run between organs
and body parts carrying Essence/_qi_/_prana_/life energy. In addition, the soul
has several anchor-points called "chakra" which facilitate the spiritual aspect
of life. Collectively, your meridian network and chakra system are called your
_subtle body_.

All illness is the result of imbalances or disruptions of the flow of energy in
the subtle body. Thus, all treatments are focused on restoring the flow of _qi_
through the meridian network or clearing blockages from the chakra flow.

## Modalities of Treatment

In the Realm, you are likely to encounter some or all of the following in the
practice of physick.

Most treatments will begin with acupuncture, herbal remedies, qigong, and food
therapy, then proceed to other methods as needed.

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture treatment is carried out by inserting tiny, thin needles at various
vital points of the subtle body. By stimulating these points, the needles
encourage good qi flow.

### Chiropractic

Chiropractic is the practice of "realignment" in the bones and muscles to
encourage the proper flow of energy. Chiropractic often involves a quick blow to
"realign" bones and treat pain.

### Cupping

Cupping involves using fire to quickly create suction inside a cup, and then
applying the cup to the skin. It causes the skin to pucker up and turn slightly
red. By gliding the cup along meridians, you can excite good flow.

### Food Therapy

Food therapy seeks to address the source of imbalance by removing impurities
from the patient's diet. This usually involves purging elemental foods from the
diet; a person with an overabundance of fire Essence, for example, would receive
a diet plan lacking in fire foods and featuring an abundance of water foods to
balance out.

### Herbalism and Animal Treatment

Herbs are an extremely common treatment, and the one you probably go to first.
Brewing teas, chewing herbs, and burning smudge sticks (moxibustion) are common
herbalist practices.

super awesome, illustrated guide to herbs in RPGs! Such a cool resource.

Animal treatment often involves animal products, like a tincture made from
boiling hen's blood or a massage oil made from beeswax or boar fat. Like herbs,
these products are consumed or applied to the skin.

### Incense and Color Therapy

In this non-invaisive treatment for chakra blockage, the patient is placed into
a room with special burning incenses and glass panes put over the lights to
produce a certain color. Exposure to these effects helps stimulate the soul to
restore balance and free flow of chakra energy in the subtle body.

### Jade and Crystal Placement

Jade stones or special crystals are placed along the meridians or pointed and
used as acupuncture needles. This treatment encourages energy flow via the
elemental associations of the stones.

### Massage Therapy

Massage therapy involves deep, sometimes painful targeted massages of meridian
points to stimulate qi flow. This one is a favorite among the aristocracy -- the
floating-on-a-cloud feeling after a good, deep painful massage is a lovely
addition to any medical treatment.

### Qigong Physical Therapy

Qigong involves a regimen of meditation and taiji practices to stimulate the
muscles and help make the body more limber; this aids in qi flow and reduces
the likelihood of recurring blockages. It also helps you get some exercise,
which is good for you overall!

### Scraping

Scraping involves running coins or stones over the skin to irritate it and, in
more severe cases, to draw a little blood. This is a last-resort method for
extreme qi blockages, or a follow-up to inconclusive cupping treatment.

### Thermal Therapy

Exposing the body to heat -- steamhouses, hot stones pressed into the skin,
etc. -- or cold -- jumping into snow or quick dives into freezing lakes -- can
excite the nerves, helping with a wide variety of complications.
