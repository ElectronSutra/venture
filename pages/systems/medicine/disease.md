# Diseases

## Disease Stats

Diseases have three major stats: virulence, morbidity, and interval.

### Virulence

Virulence is the "danger" of the disease. Mechanically, it is the difficulty you
must overcome when you resist the disease.

### Morbidity

Morbidity is the lingering harm the disease causes. It is the difficulty you
must overcome when the disease progresses.

### Interval

Interval represents how long it takes between each phase of the disease
progression.

## Disease Progression

Diseases progress through some or all of the following steps: initial exposure,
minor symptoms, major symptoms, defining symptoms, death.

### Initial Exposure

When you are initially exposed to the disease, roll (Stamina + Resistance)
versus the disease's Virulence to avoid infection. If you succeed, then you have
resisted the disease; if you fail, then the disease has begun to incubate and
you move immediately to minor symptoms.

### Minor Symptoms

Minor symptoms represents the initial stages of infection. You are ill, but not
yet impaired. You suffer no mechanical penalties, but you are beginning to
manifest diagnosable symptoms.

After an interval has passed, roll (Stamina + Resistance) versus the disease's
Morbidity. If you succeed, your disease vanishes. If you fail, you proceed to
major symptoms.

### Major Symptoms

Major symptoms represent the middle stages of infection. You are ill, and are
beginning to suffer serious difficulties as a result.

After an interval has passed, roll (Stamina + Resistance) versus the disease's
Morbidity. If you succeed, the disease regresses to minor symptoms. If you fail,
you proceed to defining symptoms.

### Defining Symptoms

Defining symptoms represent the advanced stages of the infection. You are as
sick as you are going to be. Your disease is overwhelming your body.

After an interval has passed, roll (Stamina + Resistance) versus the disease's
Morbidity. If you succeed, the disease regresses to major symptoms. If you fail,
the disease progresses to death.

### Death

You dead.

The good news is, only magical diseases can progress to this phase for the
Chosen. The bad news is, mortals are not so lucky; even simple infections can
cause death in some cases.

## Example Disease

**Consumption/Tuberculosis** (Virulence 2, Morbidity 2, Interval: One week):
This wasting disease affects the lungs and chest. As the disease progresses, the
victim begins to cough up blood and run a high fever, all while quickly losing
weight and energy. Victims usually expire when their lungs lose function
completely. Consumption is a common and horrible disease.
