# Becoming a Sorcerer

Becoming a sorcerer requires initiation into the Quiet Art via some external
power. Most sorcerers in the Realm attain their initiation via intense study at
the Heptagram; others are initiated through more esoteric means.

## Shaping Rituals

Every initiation offers a _shaping ritual_, an alternative means by which you
can accrue and store sorcerous motes. Your shaping ritual is deeply reflective
of the nature of your initiation.

## Initiation Merits

Some initiations offer Merits that you can purchase, which allow you to buy some
kind of small passive perk as a result of your connection to power.

## Example Shaping Rituals

### Heptagram Study

You have studied at the Heptagram, the premier sorcerous institution in all of
Creation. You have a large library of books. This is the most traditional
sorcerous initiation.

### Soul-Perfecting Elixir

By studying alchemy and medicine, you have created a Soul-Perfecting Elixir, a
magical potion which allows you access to sorcerous power. Your power comes from
the careful cultivation of your life-power and study of the body and mind.

### The Talisman of Ten Thousand Eyes

You have come into possession of a magical talisman, basically the Eye of
Agamoto from Dr. Strange. By focusing your power on this Eye, you can unlock
sorcerous magic and strange otherworldly power.

### Scarred By Nightmares

You have been beset upon by wicked and twisted nightmares. They invade your
sleeping mind and whisper strange power to you. A sliver of chaos and unnatural
trauma lives deep in your soul, and you can draw upon it to bend the world to
your will.

_And so forth..._
