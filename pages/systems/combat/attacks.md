# Attacks

When you make an attack, you always make a choice:

- **WITHERING**: I want to steal narrative control.
- **DECISIVE**: I want to deal a finishing blow.

These two resolve differently. **Withering** attacks are probably more common
because they're the primary way to get Initiative.

## Defense

Your Defense is the better of your Evasion or your Parry.

### Evasion

Your Evasion is equal to (Dexterity + Dodge / 2, round up).

### Parry

Your Parry is equal to ([Dexterity or Strength] + [weapon skill] / 2, round up).
You may use Strength for your Parry if you are wielding a heavy weapon.

### Undodgeable/Unblockable

If the attack is undodgeable, you must use your Parry. If the attack is
unblockable, you must use your Evasion.

## **Withering** Attacks

A **withering** attack targets your opponent's Initiative (that is, their
narrative control). If successful, it steals some of their Initiative and gives
it to you.

### **Withering** Attack Process

Roll your attack pool versus the target's Defense. Your attack pool in this case
includes your weapon's Accuracy bonus.

If you meet or exceed their Defense, you've hit successfully, and get 1i for
making a successful **withering** attack.

Subtract their Soak from your weapon's Raw Damage; raw damage is (Strength +
weapon's damage stat). Their Soak cannot reduce the damage to less than the
weapon's Overwhelming value.

For every point of damage you deal, you steal 1i from them and get it for
yourself.

#### **Withering** Attack Example

Red Crane is dueling Handsome Li. She makes a **withering** attack.

She rolls 5 successes, and his Defense is 4. She hits. She gets 1i for a
successful **withering** attack.

Her strength is 2 and she is wielding a sword (+9 dmg, 2 Ovw). Her raw damage is
11 points.

Handsome Li has light armor, so his soak is 7. Red Crane's damage is reduced by
7, to a total of 4. He loses 4i, and Red Crane gains 4i.

## Decisive Attacks

A **decisive** attack cashes in your Initiative(=narrative control) for a
dramatic blow. A successful **decisive** attack transforms your abstract
narrative control into a tangible benefit -- usually, really fucking up the
other guy.

### Resolving a **Decisive** Attack

Roll your attack pool against your target's Defense. Unlike a **withering**
attack, a **decisive** attack does _not_ include your weapon's Accuracy bonus.

If you meet or exceed your target's Defense, you have hit them and you get to
roll damage. After rolling for damage, you
[reset to base Initiative](/venture/systems/combat/initiative#base-initiative).

If you fail to hit your target, you loose a little Initiative for your failed
attempt. If your Initiative is 11+, you lose 3i; otherwise, you lose 2i. Not a
bad price, really.

### **Decisive** Damage

If your attack is successful, you roll for damage. Your damage pool on a
**decisive** attack is equal to your current Initiative value -- so if you make
an attack at 11i, you roll 11 dice of damage.

Roll your damage pool. _This is the only roll in the whole game that doesn't_
_double 10s; sorry for that weird rule_. Each success inflicts 1 level of health
damage to your target.

### **Decisive** Attack Example

Red Crane is dueling Handsome Li. She has 13 Initiative and makes a **decisive**
attack.

She rolls 4 successes, which meets or exceeds Handsome Li's 4 Defense. Her
attack hits.

She rolls 13 dice of damage. She rolls 6 successes and deals 6 levels of lethal
damage to Handsome Li. She resets to her 3i, her base Initiative.

## Gambits

A gambit is a special kind of **decisive** attack that deserves to be called
out.

A gambit lets you get an advantage other than dealing damage. If you can think
of a really cool trick like disarming, dehorsing, etc., then it is probably a
gambit.

### Resolving a Gambit

Roll to hit just like with a normal **decisive** attack.

Instead of rolling damage, roll your Initiative against the difficulty of the
gambit. If you succeed, you achieve the gambit. If you do not, then you fail
to enact the gambit.

Regardless of success, you lose (gambit difficulty + 1)i.

### Example Gambits

**Disarm (difficulty 3)**: You know the opponent's weapon out of their hands.

**Distract (difficulty 3-5)**: Instead of losing the Initiative for this gambit,
you can transfer it to an ally.

**Grapple (difficulty 2)**: You can seize your opponent in a clinch. This has a
bunch of weird rules I won't go in to here, you can check the book for them
(Core book p. 200-201).

**Coat Trick (difficulty 3)**: You yoink someone's coat up over their head,
blinding them. They start to stumble around and take a -1 to all Defenses and
-3 to all actions until they use a Miscellaneous Action to pull their coat back
down.

**Clothespin (difficulty 2)**: You use a sword or needle to pin someone's
clothes to the ground. They are stuck where they are until they pull it out.
They can use a miscellaneous action to pull it out and spare their clothes, or
they can Rush and leave a big gash in their clothes.

## Clashes

The very last thing to discuss is a _clash_.

If you and an opponent both hit each other on the same Initiative tick, you
_clash_. Instead of rolling against each others' Defense, you roll a direct
opposed roll, and the winner is whoever rolled better.
