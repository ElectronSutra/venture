# Actions

When it's your turn in combat, you can choose to do any action from the
[list of actions](#list-of-actions) on this page.

## Flurry

Normally you can only take one action on your turn. If you want to do _two_
things, you can flurry. Both actions take a -3 penalty but you get to do both.

You cannot flurry two of the same action, so no attack-attack.

## Reflexive Movement

You can move 1 range band in any direction on your turn, for free. If you're
currently engaged with someone, you will need to
[disengage from them](/venture/systems/combat/movement#disengage) to move away.

Moving _within_ your current range band is free, so be as acrobatic as you want!

## List of Actions

You may always choose from these options on your turn.

### Make an Attack

You may [make an attack](/venture/systems/combat/attacks/) against an enemy.

### Move

You may [take a special movement](/venture/systems/combat/movement), in addition
to the free move you get every turn.

### Aim

You may _aim_ on your turn. Aiming gives you 2 Initiative for free and you get a
+3 bonus to hit with your next attack.

You may aim with any weapon -- you can aim with a sword, if you want, to pull
off a called shot.

Aim cannot be flurried. In order to attack from medium range or further, you
must aim; this aim does not give you a bonus, it just lets you make an attack.

### Defend Other

You may attempt to interpose yourself between a _ward_ and anyone who would
attack them.

A character who attacks your ward must beat _your_ Parry in order to hit them.
If he can beat your Parry, then he may choose to either hit you, or try to hit
your ward by beating _your ward's Defense_. Only if he can beat _both_ of your
Defenses can he hit your ward.

### Draw/Ready Weapon

You may switch out your current weapon for a new one.

You always start a fight with your preferred weapon ready, unless it's an
ambush.

### Full Defense

You may fight defensively. If you do so, you pay 1 Initiative and boost all
your defenses by 2 until your next turn.

You can only flurry a full defense with a social influence action. You can't use
this Action if you are [Crashed](/venture/systems/initiative#crash).

### Social Influence

You can choose not to fight, and instead to take a
[social influence action](/venture/systems/social-influence). Taking a social
influence costs 1 Initiative.

### Miscellaneous Action

Anything else, like picking a lock or healing someone's wounds, is a
