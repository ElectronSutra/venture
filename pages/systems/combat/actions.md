# Combat Actions

On your turn, you get a _reflexive movement_ and you may do one or two actions
from the list on this page.

## Reflexive Movement

Once per turn for free, you may move one range band toward any opponent or
landmark on the battlefield.

## List of Actions

On your turn, you may perform any one of the following actions.

Remember: you get +5 Initiative at the end of the turn if you didn't make an
attack.

### Attack

You may make a **withering** or **decisive** attack.

### Rush

You may barrel toward a target. Roll (Strength + Athletics) against the target's
Evasion. If you succeed, then you keep your current distance until your next
turn and may reflexively move with them if they move away.

### Disengage

You may slip away from the melee you are caught in. Roll (Dexterity or
Strength + Athletics) in an opposed roll against everyone you are engaged with.
If you beat everyone, then you retreat out to short range and will reflexively
move away from them if they approach you.

### Aim

You may take aim with **any weapon** you have readied. If you aim, you get +3
dice to hit your next attack. Yes, you can aim melee weapons; you're prepping
yourself for an accurate strike.

### Defend Other

You may defend other. Pick a target within close range to become your _ward_.
Whenever anyone would attack your ward, they've got to get past you first.

You can defend your ward with your Parry. If the opponent manages to get past
your Parry, they can then apply their remaining successes against the target's
Defense -- only if they beat _both_ can they harm your ward.

### Draw/Ready Weapon

You draw or ready a new weapon to use in the fight.

### Full Defense

You get +2 Defense until your next turn.

### Social Influence

You may speak up or speak out, using your silver tongue to sway the fight. You
may use social influence in combat to try and persuade people to your side.

### Miscellaneous Action

Everything else is a miscellaneous action. You get -1 Defense until your next
turn if you take a miscellaneous action.

## Flurrying

After you complete your action, you might want to do a second. You can choose to
_flurry_ and complete a second task in a burst of action, at the cost of your
control in the fight.

You cannot flurry two of the same action -- you can't, for example, aim twice or
attack twice. Also, actions face the following restrictions:

- You can't flurry an Aim action.
- You can only flurry Full Defense with the Social Influence action.

At the end of a turn in which you chose to flurry, you lose 3i for each action
you flurried. Some benefits (like the Quick Draw merit) reduce this cost. This
is the price you pay in narrative control for doing two things at once.
