# Initiative

Initiative-with-a-capital-I is the currency that powers the _Exalted_ combat
engine.

## What Is Initiative?

Initiative-with-a-capital-I is a representation of your _narrative control_ in
a fight. If you have a higher Initiative, you are winning the fight and you are
in control; if you have a lower Initiative, you are losing the fight and are
struggling to keep your feet.

During a fight, your Initiative will go up and down as you strike and are
struck.

## Attacks

When you attack, you always make a choice:

- WITHERING: I want to seize narrative control from my target.
- DECISIVE: I want to deliver a fight-defining strike.

A **withering** attack focuses on shifting the narrative. You use a
**withering** attack to steal narrative control from your target. If you strike
a guard and send him reeling, that's a **withering** attack.

A **decisive** attack is meant to model when you hit a high point in a
cinematic fight. If you catch the sword your friend just threw you, do a cool
twirl, and behead the guard coming up from behind you, that's probably a
**decisive** attack.

### Wow Well That Sounds Really Contrived

I don't think so. I felt that way, too, when I read the combat system for the
first time, but I think it actually does pretty well at what it sets out to do:
model the _story_ of a fight rather than the mechanics.

If you go and watch that lightsaber clip, you'll see a bunch of blows that get
parried and a lot of banter. That's because those fights are supposed to be
_fun to watch_. **Withering** attacks are there to give you those cool moments
where swords clash and banter is exchanged; **decisive** attacks are there to
give you the dramatic moment where you run your sword through her gut.

Just remember that your first goal is _fun_, _exciting_, _dramatic_ theater-kid
fights, and you'll be fine.

## A Number You Should Remember

### Base Initiative

Your **base Initiative** is (2 + [Stamina / 2], rounds up).

### Join Battle

When combat begins, you start with your base Initiative. Then, you roll (Wits +
Awareness), and every success gives you 1 more Initiative at the start of the
fight. This roll is called _Join Battle_.

## A Special Way You Can Get Fucked Up

Here are a couple more Magic Special Words that I wrote down here so that I can
reference them from other pages.

### Initiative Crash

Uh oh, you made a big fucky and got riggidy-shriggidy-shrecked. _Crash_ happens
if you ever hit 0 or less Initiative. This represents that you have been
completely blindsided and lost control of the fight.

If you're Crashed, you can't make **decisive** attacks (no juice) and you can't
use any Charm with the Perilous keyword; you're mega screwed.

If you survive 3 turns in Crash, you reset to base Initiative.

### Break

Forcing someone into Crash is called _Breaking_ them. If you Break someone, you
get a bonus +5 Initiative for being large and in-charge.

### Shift

If you can Break the bastard who just Broke you, you are super cool and pull
off something called a _Shift_. When you Shift, you get to roll Join Battle
again (giving you a ton of narrative go-juice just for being cool), and get to
act again immediately.
