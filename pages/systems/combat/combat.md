# The Red Art of Violence

The goal of the combat system in _Exalted_ is to provide a framework for punchy,
cinematic fights with lots of flourishes, banter, and aesthetics. It cares much
more about "look and feel" than simulation. The foremost goal of the combat
system is _not_ to have a fight; it is to provide a _cinematic scene_ that
happens to involve violence.

Your role in combat is not as a participant so much as a director or
choreographer.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esnMDtMysHo) of lightsaber
fights from the _Star Wars_ franchise. Does it make sense that space monks use
laser swords the way that they do? No, not really. But it makes for _great_
_viewing_, which is the important part. Similarly, in _Exalted_, the focus is
not on realism -- the focus is on _theater_. IF you can think of cool
flourishes, crazy flips, ridiculous boasts... All of those things belong on the
battlefield.
