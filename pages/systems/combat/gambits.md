# Gambits

A _gambit_ is any attempt to create a temporary or permanent effect with
tactical and tangible importance in combat. Any non-magical action that alters
the battlefield or tactical situation can be modeled as a gambit.

## Example Gambits

- Topple a pho cart to obstruct the bad guys.
- Disarm your opponent and send their sword flying.
- Collapse the bridge you're fighting on.
- Knock your opponent off his horse.
- Throw knives to catch the opponent's clothes and prevent him from moving.
- Use a prayer strip to trap the opponent in a specific area.

The sky's the limit and you're bound only by your imagination.

## Creating Scenery

What if you want to topple a pho cart, but there isn't one that's been mentioned
so far? If you're fighting in a city, you just... Do it.

Make one up! As long as it is reasonable that it exists in the scene, you're
allowed to throw in new details as part of a stunt.

## Resolving a Gambit

Describe what you want to accomplish. If it hasn't been attempted before, I will
come up with an appropriate price.

If you are targeting another character, you will probably need to make an
opposed roll against them.

If you are targeting the scenery, you will probably just succeed; some special
situations, like feats of strength, might call for a roll.

Then, if you succeeded, you pay the gambit's cost in Initiative.
