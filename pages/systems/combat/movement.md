# Movement

Let's talk about distance and movement.

## Range Bands

_Exalted_ does not measure distance in feet or squares. It uses an abstract idea
of "range bands" to measure distance.

Range bands are all relative. Handsome Li is at medium range from both Red Crane
and Jun. If Red Crane and Jun are standing next to each other, then they are
close to one another; but, if they are standing on opposite sides of Handsome
Li, then they might be long range from one another. See how it's relative?

There are a few range bands to keep in mind:

- CLOSE: Close range is right up against one another. You have to be close to
  someone to melee or brawl with them.
- SHORT: You're a quick dash away from someone. You can close in quickly. This
  is the ideal range for making ranged attacks.
- MEDIUM: You're far enough away from someone that you have to holler. You'll
  need quite a bit of movement to close in.
- LONG: You're far enough away from someone that you need some kind of signal
- to communicate, like a flag or waving your arms.
  EXTREME: You're a speck on the horizon.

### Reflexive Movement

Remember that every turn you can move 1 range band in any direction for free.

You can move within a range band as much as you like, as long as it doesn't
change your relative positioning. So go nuts with your acrobatics!

## Movement Actions

In addition to your reflexive move, you can choose to use one of the following
movement actions on your turn.

### Rush

You may rush your opponent to close in. You roll (Dexterity + Athletics) against
his (Dexterity + Athletics). If you win, then you will follow him as he moves,
one range band at a time, until your next turn.

### Disengage

You may disengage with an opponent in close range if you want to get away. You
roll (Dexterity + Dodge) against the (Dexterity + Athletics) of whoever it is
that you are close to. If you beat _all_ of your opposed rolls, then you can
move out to short range and you will automatically retreat to keep pace with
them.

### Other

You can _rise from prone_ if you've been knocked down. It takes a whole action.

You can _withdraw_ from the fight if you want to leave. You must not be close
to any opponents or they will block you. Withdrawing is an extended (Dexterity +
Athletics) roll, difficulty 1 goal 10. Every turn you withdraw, you lose 10i
until you're either back in the fight or you disappear completely.
