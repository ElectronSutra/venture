# Administration

Administration is the aspect of Bureaucracy you use to maneuver within an
existing system.

If you want to be brief, administration covers "interacting with your boss."

## Administrative Tasks

All administrative tasks fall into one of two categories: minor tasks and major
tasks.

### Minor Tasks

Minor tasks are routine bureaucratic endeavors that involve, at most, a handful
of people. A peasant requesting travel papers is an example of a minor task.

### Major Tasks

A major task involves many people and layers of approval. It is a large endeavor
that requries an investment of time and energy. A magistrate auditing a Prince's
finances is a major task.

## Describing Tasks

A bureaucratic task has a goal which describes the intended result. In addition,
every task has a Speed which describes the pace it moves at.

### Goal

The goal of a task describes the intended result. An example goal is "acquire
travel papers for Red Crane." When the task is completed, the goal will be
achieved.

### Speed

Every task has a Speed at which it moves. This Speed describes how long you can
expect the process to take.

| Speed | Description  |
| :---- | :----------- |
| 1     | Instant(ish) |
| 2     | Minutes      |
| 3     | Hours        |
| 4     | Days         |
| 5     | Weeks        |
| 6     | Months       |
| 7     | Seasons      |
| 8     | Years        |
| 9     | Decades      |
| 10    | Centuries    |
| 11    | Forever      |

## Resolving Tasks

### Resolving a Minor Task

A minor task is a single roll with Bureaucracy with the specified Difficulty. It
takes as long as the Speed to resolve.

> Getting Papers for Red Crane (Minor Bureaucratic Task, Difficulty 2,
> Speed 4)

## Resolving a Major Task

A major task requires an extended roll. The difficulty and goal number of the
task are set by the Storyteller.

The interval for this extended roll is the Speed.

> Auditing the Finances of the Ji-Su Family (Major Bureaucratic Task, difficulty
> 2, Speed 5, Goal 20)
