# Combat Actions

## New Captain Actions

In addition to the normal set of combat actions, the captain gains access to two
new actions that impact shipboard combat: Generate Tempo and Spend Tempo.

### Generate Tempo

The captain may _generate tempo_ for the boat. Roll (Wits + Sail) and generate
1 tempo for every success you roll.

### Spend Tempo

The captain may _spend tempo_ as part of her action, gaining any single effect
listed on the [tempo table](/systems/sailing/combat#tempo-table).
