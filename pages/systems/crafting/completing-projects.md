# Completing Projects

Completing a project depends on the type of project.

## Basic Projects

### Beginning a Basic Project

All you need to start a basic project is the appropriate tools. Basic projects
do not require a project slot.

### Completing a Basic Project

A basic project takes an indeterminate amount of time: several minutes or
several hours of labor.

When you have finished your basic project, roll with Craft.

Completing a basic project costs _no_ experience.

### Rewards for a Basic Project

Successfully completing a basic project grants 2sxp per [basic objective](/venture/systems/craft/experience#basic-objectives).

If you roll at least 3 successes over the difficulty of the roll, you instead
get 3sxp per basic objective.

## Major Projects

### Beginning a Major Project

To begin a major project, you must have appropriate tools and an available
[major project slot](/venture/systems/craft/project-slots#major-project-slots).
If all three of your project slots are committed, you must buy a new one.

### Completing a Major Project

A major project takes an indeterminate amount of time: usually several hours to
several days of labor.

When you have finished your project, spend 10sxp and roll with Craft. If you
fail, you can roll again by spending a further 10sxp per attempt.

### Rewards for a Major Project

Successfully completing a major project grants 2gxp and 1sxp per [basic objective](/venture/systems/craft/experience#basic-objectives).

If you completed the project exceptionally well (at least 3 success above what
you need), you get 3gxp and 1sxp.

## Superior Projects

### Beginning a Superior Project

Creating an Artifact requires a minimum of Lore 3, Occult 3, and at least 1
relevant Craft 4. Large-scale construction does not require Ability minimums.

Creating a superior project requires a [superior project slot](/venture/systems/craft/project-slots#superior-project-slots).

### Completing a Superior Project

Superior projects require a minimum time based on their rating:

- Project 2: Six weeks
- Project 3: Three months
- Project 4: One year
- Project 5: Two years.

Completing a superor project is an extended roll with difficulty 5, terminus 6,
and goal

- Project 2: goal 30
- Project 3: goal 50
- Project 4: goal 75
- Project 5: goal 100

Every time you roll to progress the project, spend 10gxp. A botch immediately
ruins the project. Sucks.

### Rewards for a Superior Project

You gain a reward based on the rating of the project you completed:

- Project 2: 3wxp
- Project 3: 5wxp
- Project 4: 7wxp
- Project 5: 10wxp

For every unused interval remaining, you gain (rating)*2 gxp.

## Legendary Projects

Legendary projects are ancient mysteries and beyond the scope of this simple
guide...
