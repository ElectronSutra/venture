# Crafting Experience

Crafting generates three colors of experience: silver, gold, and white.

## Colors of Experience

### Silver Experience

Silver experience (sxp) is earned from completing basic projects, and spent in
order to complete major projects.

### Gold Experience

Gold experience (gxp) is earned from completing major projects, and spent to
complete superior projects.

### White Experience

White experience (wxp) is earned from completing superior projects, and used to
complete the legendary projects that elude even the greatest crafters -- lucky
that you're a player!

## Basic Objectives

Most projects award you experience based off of triggering a _basic objective_.
These are the three basic objectives it is referring to:

- Finishing your project causes another character to gain or strengthen an
  Intimacy toward you or your work;
- Finishing your project creates a clear in-game advantage for your character;
- Finishing your project upholds, furthers, or protects one of your Intimacies.

So in order to be maximally effective at crafting things, you'll want to build
things that are _valuable to you_, _valuable to others_, and _advance your_
_goals_. Makes sense, right?
