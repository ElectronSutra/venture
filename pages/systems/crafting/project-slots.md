# Project Slots

Project slots are an abstract representation of your ability to split your
attention and work in parallel.

By default, you have 3 major project slots.

## Major Project Slots

You must commit a major project slot if you are working on a major project.

You have 3 major project slots just for being a character. You can spend 5 sxp
to purchase a new major project slot whenever you need one.

## Superior Project Slots

You must commit a superior project slot if you are working on a superior
project.

You have _no_ superior project slots to start with. You may create a major
project slot by fusing major project slots together. For a rank _N_ project, you
must fuse _N_ major project slots and spend _N_ gxp to create an appropriate
slot.

_Example_: A rank 3 project requires 3 major project slots and costs 3gxp.
