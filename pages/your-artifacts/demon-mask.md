# Demon Mask

## Jade Monster Mask, Artifact 2

The sneering visage of this mask is the mark of a professional monster hunter.
Each of these Artifacts is carved by a master for her apprentice when he is
ready to progress to journeyman hunter. The monster hunters have many sayings
that relate back to their iconic masks -- among them "hanging the mask on the
mantle," a euphemism for being slain in the line of duty.

A demon mask counts as an exceptional tool (+1 non-Charm bonus die) to track a
monster; its footprints, no matter how old, are outlined in a gentle glowing
energy, and its scent trail becomes visible as a nasty fog.

Additionally, while the hunter is wearing the mask, all monsters are treated as
if they had a Minor Tie of fear toward her.
