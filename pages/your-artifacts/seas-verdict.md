# Sea's Verdict

## Black Jade Longfang, Artifact 3

Peleps Lirel was sent West to Zumachi to hold the wheel-priests accountable for
their crimes. As she approached, the three wheel-priests begged their elemental
god, the serpent Vortex of Scales, to destroy her ship. When it sunk, they
likely thought they had won. They were wrong.

Peleps Lirel strode from the waves dragging the immense body of Vortex of
Scales. She recited the crimes of the wheel-priests as she approached. They
threw themselves at her feet, begging her for mercy, offering her anything that
she desired.

She bound them in silver chains atop the black jade monolith where they had
sacrificed hundreds of their own to appease Vortex of Scales. She watched as
they drowned in the rising tide, and hewed Sea's Verdict from the monolith.

In her final report to House Peleps, she included "attempted bribery" as the
wheel-priests' final crime.

Since it was hewn by Peleps Lirel, Sea's Verdict has been wielded by the heroes
of House Peleps to put down pirates and hunt evildoers. It is a reminder to
those that wield it that the sea is unforgiving -- it has only one verdict,
which it returns without hesitance.

## Aesthetics

Sea's Verdict is a black jade trident. It is engraved with silver serpents along
the haft, and the prongs are tipped in hungry silver. As it gains power, the
serpents writhe and dissolve like broken chains. At its most powerful, the jade
itself begins to crack, rumble, and leak salty, dark water.

## Evocations of Sea's Verdict

Sea's Verdict has its own anima banner in parallel to yours. Whenever you spend
5m or more from your peripheral pool to enhance a single attack, Parry, or
evocation, Sea's Verdict gains another level of its anima.

When its anima is at burning, Sea's Verdict gains the Smashing tag. When its
anima is at bonfire, Sea's Verdict can make Smashing attacks with no cost and
no Defense penalty.

Verdict.

Whenever you draw Sea's Verdict from a large body of open water -- either by
submerging it, emerging from the body with it, or using the Charm

_Sea's Verdict is heavy with the weight of the sea. Its forks twirl with black_
_Water Essence as it washes away all foes._

Sea's Verdict must be at burning or higher to use this Evocation.

Make a **withering** or **decisive** Smashing attack with no Defense penalty
against an enemy in close range. Every other opponent within close range of your
target must make a Stay on Their Feet roll (usually Strength and Athletics)
against difficulty (your Essence + 2). If they fail, they also go flying along
with your main target.

_Sea's Verdict builds up a huge wave of black Water Essence, which you release_
_in a sudden wave of salty sea that crashes down against anything in your way._

Before you make your attack, make a reflexive feat of demolition against any
object in your opponent's range band. You get (Sea's Verdict's anima * 2) bonus
dice, and your Strength is (Sea's Verdict's anima) higher than usual when
checking what you can destroy. You can use this Evocation to destroy cover your
opponent is hiding behind before you roll your attack.

## Essence 2

### Lost Blade Riptide

> **Cost**: 5m, 2i, 1a from Sea's Verdict
>
> **Type**: Supplemental (Attack); **Duration**: Instant
>
> **Keywords**: Decisive-only
>
> **Prerequisites**: [Hull-Breaking Tsunami Swipe](#hull-breaking-tsunami-swipe)

_Sea's Verdict's prongs spin and twist, their hungry silver eager to spring_
_forth. A whirl of black water rips your opponent's weapons away._

If your opponent tries to Parry this attack, you can roll a reflexive disarm
gambit against them before they defend. If you successfully disarm them, not
only does their sword go flying, but they also can only use Evasion to try and
avoid your attack.
