# Plum Garden Fangs

## Green Jade Hooked Daiklaves, Artifact 3

In order to break her curse and free her sisters from the clutches of the raksha
Scorpion King, Jurul Sparrowhawk agreed to complete eight trials. The third of
them was to slay Tsichu the All-Consuming Maw.

Tsichu was a spider-serpent of immense size, ravenous and cruel. It had made its
nest among the roots beneath the Plum Garden, a sacred tree deep in the Eseon
Forest whose fruit could heal any wound. There Tsichu had chewed out a labyrinth
in the earth. It had gnawed jade until it's fangs were stone and swallowed
demon-gold until its hide was like mail.

Sparrowhawk enlisted the help of the blossom-spirits. Protected from Tsichu's
deadly venom by their plum wine, she slew the beast by grabbing it's glittering
jeweled fangs and tearing the spider-serpent apart.

The Plum Garden Fangs served House Jurul for many years, and were one of the
many Artifacts awarded to House Ledaal upon Jurul's destruction.

## Aesthetics

The Plum Garden Fangs are a pair of green jade hooked daiklaves. Their handles
are eastern steelwood and wrapped in black spider silk. The detailing on the
handles is hungry silver, to contain the ravenous hunger of Tsichu lingering in
the fangs.
