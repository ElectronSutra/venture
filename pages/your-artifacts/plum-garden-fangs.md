# Plum Garden Fangs

## Green Jade Hooked Daiklaves, Artifact 3

In order to break her curse and free her sisters from the clutches of the raksha
Scorpion King, Jurul Sparrowhawk agreed to complete eight trials. The third of
them was to slay Tsichu the All-Consuming Maw.

Tsichu was a spider-serpent of immense size, ravenous and cruel. It had made its
nest among the roots beneath the Plum Garden, a sacred tree deep in the Eseon
Forest whose fruit could heal any wound. There Tsichu had chewed out a labyrinth
in the earth. It had gnawed jade until it's fangs were stone and swallowed
demon-gold until its hide was like mail.

Sparrowhawk enlisted the help of the blossom-spirits. Protected from Tsichu's
deadly venom by their plum wine, she slew the beast by grabbing it's glittering
jeweled fangs and tearing the spider-serpent apart.

The Plum Garden Fangs served House Jurul for many years, and were one of the
many Artifacts awarded to House Ledaal upon Jurul's destruction.

## Aesthetics

The Plum Garden Fangs are a pair of green jade hooked daiklaves. Their handles
are eastern steelwood and wrapped in black spider silk. The detailing on the
handles is hungry silver, to contain the ravenous hunger of Tsichu lingering in
the fangs.

## Evocations of the Plum Garden Fangs

The Plum Garden Fangs are normally _quiescent_. When they deal at least two
levels of lethal **decisive** damage, or when poison produced by the blades
deals at least 1 level of lethal damage in a scene, the blades become
_ravenous_.

While ravenous, the edges of the blades become serrated and the jade shifts
with hungry shadows. The Plum Garden Fangs get +1 Overwhelming, and can only
deal lethal or aggravated damage.

_The urticating hairs that adorn the Plum Garden Fangs burrow into your victim,_

_As Tsichu once devoured the many, so the Plum Garden Fangs now devour the few._
_They fly through the air, tethered to your wrists by glowing Essence, and_
_drag your prey into your maw._

Make a grapple gambit against an opponent out to short range. You use Martial
Arts or Melee instead of Brawl for the gambit and control rolls.

If you win control of the grapple, you drag your opponent into close range if
they are not already. You _must_ make a savage action as your first action in
control.

_The Plum Garden Fangs are meant to strike and kill with the blinding speed of_
_a devouring predator. Easy for Naiyo, a hunter himself._

Make a counterattack against an enemy out to short range.

If your target is at short range, you automatically leap one range band toward
them. If your target is at close range, you get a surprise attack against them.
