# Ten Thousand Dragons Rule the World

The Dragon-Blooded are the divine Princes of the Earth, heroes of legend who
distill the might of the Elemental Dragons in their blood. They rule the Realm,
the mighty empire at the world's heart that wraps around Creation like a hungry
snake. With the power of the world's greatest empire at their back, the
Dragon-Blooded stand astride Creation like a colossus.

Welcome home...

> Welcome to Venture, a website I created and maintain for my _Exalted_ 3rd
> edition Dragon-Blooded campaign. This website is a compilation of my own
> lore write-ups, expending on the information available in _The Realm_ and in
> the _Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought_ rulebook. I have also integrated
> LOTS of mechanical reworks and homebrew in the "Systems" section. If you
> notice that things differ from the books, it's largely down to that.

> Please bear in mind that the website, **especially** section #1 "The Realm,"
> is deliberately **not** written in an impartial voice. My goal is to convey
> the Realm to my players as they, as characters raised within the society,
> understand it. These write-ups **are biased** and **deliberately include**
> **imperial perspectives** to reflect the privileged upbringing of the
> Dynasty. Callous references to human bondage, the natural right-to-rule of
> imperialist authority, and other detestable perspectives, are meant to
> reflect the Realm's mode of thinking and are not endorsements of imperialism.

> I am neither a historian nor an ethnographer nor a scholar of religion nor any
> other humanities specialist; I am a privileged American, and as such, 
> reflect my upbringing. The Realm is heavily inspired by cultures which are not
> my own. I recognize my responsibility in handling non-American inspirations,
> and I have done my best to do research and vet my writing in a community
> which includes non-American contributors and people of color. I certainly
> cannot claim that my writing is free of otherness or free of bias -- but I
> _can_ affirm that I am receptive to feedback and doing the best that I can to
> reflect my sources of inspiration based on research and feedback rather than
> stereotypes.
