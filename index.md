# Ten Thousand Dragons Rule the World

The Dragon-Blooded are the divine Princes of the Earth, heroes of legend who
distill the might of the Elemental Dragons in their blood. They rule the Realm,
the mighty empire at the world's heart that wraps around Creation like a hungry
snake. With the power of the world's greatest empire at their back, the
Dragon-Blooded stand astride Creation like a colossus.
