Questions </h1> <p>What kind of character do you want to play? What is your history? What are your beliefs and traditions?</p> <p>The Realm is a society which is often dissimilar to our own. This process is designed to guide you through a series of leading questions to help you build a character that fits within the Realm. Your answers will guide you to create a character that <em>belongs</em> in Creation.</p> <h2 id="section-i-the-broad-strokes"> <a href="#section-i-the-broad-strokes" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section I: The Broad Strokes </h2> <p>These questions define your character in broad terms. These answers will inform, but not restrict, your answers to later questions.</p> <h3 id="1-what-great-house-raised-you"> <a href="#1-what-great-house-raised-you" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 1. What Great House raised you? </h3> <p>The dragons of the Realm mostly belong to the ten Great Houses. Each House is a heroic lineage that stretches back to a legendary founder. Your House raised you; your world is rooted in the world your House showed you.</p> <p>When choosing your House, you should choose whichever House you find interesting or whichever has a suite of themes you want to engage with. Each House will have a different set of expectations and habits that it imposed on you as a child. It is up to you whether you live up to them or rail against them.</p> <p>Choose one of the following Great Houses which you were raised in:</p> <ul> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/cathak/"><strong>House Cathak</strong>.</a> A military house famed for brilliant tacticians and powerful Legions.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/cynis/"><strong>House Cynis</strong>.</a> A luxurious and decadent House with a reputation for debauchery and intrigue.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/ledaal/"><strong>House Ledaal</strong>.</a> A zealous and traditional House devoted to upholding the social order.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/mnemon/"><strong>House Mnemon</strong>.</a> A proud, devout House with a deeply-involved guiding hand.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/nelens/"><strong>House Nellens</strong>.</a> A scrappy House of mongrels and thin-bloods.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/peleps/"><strong>House Peleps</strong>.</a> A beloved House of folk heroes charged with maintaining the Imperial Navy.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/ragara/"><strong>House Ragara</strong>.</a> An obscenely wealthy House of bankers and merchants with a finger in every pie.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/sesus/"><strong>House Sesus</strong>.</a> A secretive military House with a reputation for spycraft and deviousness.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/tepet/"><strong>House Tepet</strong>.</a> An ancient military House with a warrior tradition older than the Realm itself.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/vneef/"><strong>House V’neef</strong>.</a> An upstart House, less than 60 years old, trying to bust its way onto the stage.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Define</strong> at least one Intimacy related to your House. How do you feel about your House? About its reputation? Do you live up to your family’s expectations, or do you defy their commands? Are you proud of your House? Embarassed? Does your House embrace you as a success or alienate you as an embarassment?</p> <h3 id="2-what-is-your-aspect"> <a href="#2-what-is-your-aspect" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 2. What is your Aspect? </h3> <p>Every Dragon-Blood reflects all five elements in their soul. At the same time, each Prince of the Earth feels a particular element more strongly than her sisters. This element is your <em>Aspect</em>; it reflects your nature and informs your legend.</p> <p>Aside from House Nellens, each Great House has a dominant Aspect that manifests more often than others. About half of all of a House’s scions will manifest the dominant element; going against your House’s Aspect is not so rare as to be noteworthy. You are free to pick whichever Aspect you like, regardless of your House.</p> <p>Choose which of the five elements you resonate with the most:</p> <ul> <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#air/"><strong>Air</strong>.</a> Air is subtle and clever, but distant and cold.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#earth/"><strong>Earth</strong>.</a> Earth is enduring and wise, but conservative and stubborn.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#fire/"><strong>Fire</strong>.</a> Fire is hot and powerful, but impulsive and dangerous.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#water/"><strong>Water</strong>.</a> Water is flexible and insightful, but duplicitous and malleable.</li> <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#wood/"><strong>Wood</strong>.</a> Wood is lively and persistent, but hedonistic and venomous.</li> </ul> <p>Having selected your Aspect, mark your five Aspect Abilities. In Lot Casting Atemi, they will be automatically filled-in when you select your Aspect. You get one free dot in each of these five Abilities.</p> <p><strong>Consider</strong> how your Aspect influences your personality. All dragons reflect their element in some way; or perhaps their element reflects them. In the notes section of your character sheet, write down at least one personality trait and one physical trait that reflect your Aspect.</p> <h2 id="section-ii-skills-and-education"> <a href="#section-ii-skills-and-education" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section II: Skills and Education </h2> <p>Your character has both natural aptitudes and learned skills. In this section, we will walk through your innate talents, your education, and your professional life.</p> <h3 id="3-in-what-ways-did-you-stand-out-among-your-peers"> <a href="#3-in-what-ways-did-you-stand-out-among-your-peers" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 3. In what ways did you stand out among your peers? </h3> <p>Which of the following statements do you agree with the most? Which do you agree with the least?</p> <blockquote> <p>I was physically superior; I was stronger, faster, or more durable.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I was socially superior; I was more charismatic, more wily, or more sensual.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I was mentally superior; I was more perceptive, more intelligent, or wittier.</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement you agree with most defines your <em>primary</em> Attributes. The statement you agree with second-most unsurprisingly defines your <em>secondary</em> Attributes. The statement you agree with the least defins your <em>tertiary</em> Attributes.</p> <p>Every Attribute begins with 1 dot for free, congratulations. Now <strong>distribute</strong> 8 more dots among your primary Attributes, 6 more dots among your secondary Attributes, and 4 more dots among your tertiary attributes.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> at least one self-reflective Intimacy that relates to your Attributes. If you have high Strength but low Intelligence, perhaps you consider yourself a stupid brute; etc.</p> <h3 id="4-what-secondary-school-did-you-attend-and-how-did-you-stand-out"> <a href="#4-what-secondary-school-did-you-attend-and-how-did-you-stand-out" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 4. What secondary school did you attend and how did you stand out? </h3> <p>As an exceptional scion of one of the Great Houses, you were lucky enough to be able to attend one of the Realm’s great secondary schools. You almost certainly had very little say in <em>which one</em>; your family probably arranged it as soon as you were born.</p> <p>However you, as a player, get to <strong>choose</strong>. Congratulations! Pick one of the following options for where you attended your secondary school:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Cloister of Wisdom</strong>. You were sent to the Cloister of Wisdom, a monastery and school all at once. While there, you learned the virtues of clarity, tranquility, and purpose. About half your classmates went on to become monks.</li> <li><strong>The Heptagram</strong>. You were sent to the distant freezing Isle of Voices to study at the Heptagram, <em>the</em> premier academy of sorcery and mysticism. You were taught the values of wisdom, fortitude, and drive, as well as set down the lonely path of the sorcerer.</li> <li><strong>The House of Bells</strong>. You were sent to the House of Bells; there is no finer military academy anywhere in Creation! You were drilled in the virtues of courage, strength, and discipline. You served for a time in the Legions or Navy as a commissioned officer and probably have plenty of war stories.</li> <li><strong>The Spiral Academy</strong>. The Academy teaches one rule, and well: You cannot rule without understanding what you rule. At the Academy, you were instructed in the virtues of knowledge, subtlety, and precision. You probably entered the bureaucracy,. and likely a handful of your schoolmates went on to be spies.</li> <li><strong>Pasiap’s Stair</strong>. Uh oh, you made a big fucky; or, you were really brave. The Stair is a military academy, but it’s not like the comfortable life at the House of Bells; no no, the Stair is an unforgiving march with no comfort and no mercy, only glory. You are well-acquainted with your many foreign schoolmates.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Consider</strong> how you stood out at school; were you especially studious, or maybe unusually good at dueling? Pick 5 Abilities that you excel at; they cannot be the same 5 as your Aspect. Mark them on your sheet as <em>favored</em>. You get 1 free dot in each.</p> <h3 id="5-what-skills-have-you-acquired-during-your-life"> <a href="#5-what-skills-have-you-acquired-during-your-life" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 5. What skills have you acquired during your life? </h3> <p>You have acquired skills from your time in primary school, your time in secondary school, and your adult life. What are those skills?</p> <p><strong>Distribute</strong> 20 additional dots, however you choose, among <em>all</em> the Abilities on your character sheet. Think about your time as an adult and your prior experiences to inform your skills. Perhaps you learned field medicine to justify your points in Medicine, and so forth.</p> <p>In answering this question, you cannot raise any Ability above 3 dots.</p> <h3 id="6-what-areas-have-you-specialized-in"> <a href="#6-what-areas-have-you-specialized-in" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 6. What areas have you specialized in? </h3> <p>You have specialties in several skills; these are important because they increase the power of some of your Charms.</p> <p>Based on your secondary school, <strong>choose</strong> two of the three listed Abilities to gain a Specialty. Remember, you must have at least 1 dot in an Ability to have a specialty in it.</p> <ul> <li>If you attended the <strong>Cloister of Wisdom</strong>, choose two specialties from among: Integrity, Lore, Martial Arts.</li> <li>If you attended the <strong>Heptagram</strong>, choose two specialties from among: Craft, Lore, Occult.</li> <li>If you attended the <strong>House of Bells</strong>, choose two specialties from among: Archery, Melee, War.</li> <li>If you attended the <strong>Spiral Academy</strong>, choose two specialties from among: Bureaucracy, Presence, Socialize.</li> <li>If you attended <strong>Pasiap’s Stair</strong>, choose two specialties from among: Athletics, Resistance, War.</li> </ul> <p>Then, <strong>choose</strong> three more skills to receive a Specialty.</p> <h2 id="section-iii-duty-and-ambition"> <a href="#section-iii-duty-and-ambition" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section III: Duty and Ambition </h2> <p>You are a scion of the mightiest empire in the world. You are neither idle nor satisfied; you have duties, and you desire something more. This section will help you determine them.</p> <h3 id="7-who-do-you-owe-a-duty-to-and-what-is-your-duty"> <a href="#7-who-do-you-owe-a-duty-to-and-what-is-your-duty" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 7. Who do you owe a duty to and what is your duty? </h3> <p>You have not made it to adult life without acquiring attachments. You owe your time and energy to someone or something – not just owe, but <em>want</em> to owe. This is a burden you have <em>chosen</em> to take on – or you have chosen is your least bad option.</p> <p><strong>Choose</strong> who you owe a duty to. Are you employed, and owe your time to your career? Are you a monk, and owe your duty to your faith and abbot? Have you taken on a duty from your House, and owe it to your family?</p> <p><strong>Choose</strong> your duty. Here are some examples of duties you might choose to take on:</p> <ul> <li>You are a minister. You have joined the bureaucracy and are part of the execution of government. Maybe you work for the Treasury and travel the Isle to collect delinquent taxes. Maybe you work for the Infallible Conveyors to carry post to far-flung and distant villages. Etc. You owe a duty to “the government.”</li> <li>You are a Legionnaire. You are a career soldier, and have served overseas in enforcing the will of the Empress. You now take up arms on the Isle, hunting down bandits and subduing rebellions. You owe a duty to “the Legions.”</li> <li>You are a merchant. You have become a respected trader, buying here and selling there to accumulate jade for yourself and your House. You owe a duty to “yourself.”</li> <li>You are a monk. You have eschewed personal wealth and even your own name, and devoted yourself to the spiritual. You travel as a preacher and officiant, and sometimes as a ringing strike to the ear to get the wicked back in line. You owe a duty to “the Immaculate Order.”</li> <li>You are a senator. You have been nominated by your House to take up a position in the Upper Chamber of the Deliberative, taking part in writing the laws of the Realm. You owe a duty to “the Realm.”</li> <li>You are a spy. Your family has given you a cover – something harmless, but that lets you get around. You gather up secrets and feed them back to your House, or to the highest bidder. You owe a duty to “your House.”</li> </ul> <p>And so on and so forth.</p> <p>Your duty should be both active and flexible. “Active” means that it is something that you <em>do</em>, and that you can pursue. “Flexible” means that it is something you can pursue in various times and places – it is not confined to something too specific to be relevant in various parts of our story.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> a Tie related to the person or organization that you owe your duty.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> a Principle that reflects your duty.</p> <p>One of those two should be at least a Major Intimacy.</p> <h3 id="8-what-do-you-deeply-desire-and-how-does-it-conflict-with-your-duty"> <a href="#8-what-do-you-deeply-desire-and-how-does-it-conflict-with-your-duty" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 8. What do you deeply desire, and how does it conflict with your duty? </h3> <p>The Princes of the Earth are greedy and sneaky bastards, to a one. Oh sure, some of them become monks, and some of them are good people, but all of them <em>want</em> something. They all have a <em>goal</em>.</p> <p>Your goal is something that you will fight for that is not your duty. In fact, a good goal <em>conflicts</em> with your duty, at least occasionally. The simple fact that you <em>want</em> A but <em>have to do</em> B can drive a pretty compelling story.</p> <p>Your goal and your duty don’t have to always conflict, but they should at least sometimes. To define your goal, ask yourself: what do I want so badly that I will abandon my duty and possibly screw over my own people in order to get it?</p> <p>As with your duty, a good goal is both active and flexible.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that expresses your goal. It should be at least Major.</p> <h3 id="9-what-is-your-relationship-to-your-family"> <a href="#9-what-is-your-relationship-to-your-family" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 9. What is your relationship to your family? </h3> <p>You already have an Intimacy related to your House. For this question, you should think more specifically about your <em>family</em>.</p> <p>There’s a saying in the Realm: “A good mother raises her child to be strong; a weak mother raises her child to be happy.” That in itself about sums up how parenting works in the Realm: affection from your parents is neither expected nor derided, as long as you grow up to be a proper Prince of the Earth.</p> <p>Were your parents close or distant? Did you have a favored sibling or nanny? Was there a house slave that you were personally close to? Do you resent your family, or do you love them?</p> <p>Another thing to consider is <em>marriage</em>. It is absolutely expected in the Realm that every Dragon-Blooded – monks excepted – will marry. Marriage is almost always a primarily political affair, to consolidate the relationships between two Houses or two families within the same House. Are you married? If you are, what is your relationship to your spouse? If you are not, how have you managed to evade your House’s matchmaking?</p> <p>Have you managed to achieve a rare love marriage? Most Dragon-Blooded have affairs outside of their marriage; this is accepted and even expected, as long as they are discrete. Men face more stigma for affairs, since everyone knows that men are irresponsible.</p> <p>The other burden is <em>children</em>. Every Dragon-Blooded – monks excepted – is expected to produce children about every twenty or thirty years, in order to raise more scions for your House. Although the Realm is completely accepting of homosexuality, sexual orientation is no excuse for failure to produce kids – either you’ll grin and bear it and have a kid because love and attraction don’t factor in to it, or you will be expected to seek sorcerous assistance to conceive a child.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> at least one Intimacy related to a family member. Also <strong>consider</strong> if you have a spouse and/or any children – make a note of them in the Notes section of your character sheet.</p> <h2 id="section-iv-history"> <a href="#section-iv-history" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section IV: History </h2> <p>This section will guide you in defining your character’s history and legend up to this point.</p> <h3 id="10-what-advantages-have-you-accumulated-in-life"> <a href="#10-what-advantages-have-you-accumulated-in-life" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 10. What advantages have you accumulated in life? </h3> <p>Every character has a suite of <a href="/character-creation/merits"><em>Merits</em></a>, which represent their advantages. Check out the Merits section for the complete list.</p> <p><strong>Distribute</strong> 13 dots of merits however you like. Then, you get 5 more dots to distribute among Backing, Command, Contacts, Followers, Influence, Language, Resources and Retainers, to represent your privileged position in society. That is a total of 18 points of Merits.</p> <h3 id="11-what-is-your-greatest-accomplishment-so-far"> <a href="#11-what-is-your-greatest-accomplishment-so-far" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 11. What is your greatest accomplishment so far? </h3> <p>What is the thing you have accomplished that you are most proud of? What is the thing that others would consider your greatest accomplishment? <strong>Consider</strong> your greatest achievement so far, and make a note of it on your character sheet.</p> <p>This should probably tie in to your Merits – maybe it involves your Command, or you were able to accomplish it because of your Backing.</p> <h3 id="12-what-is-your-worst-failure-so-far"> <a href="#12-what-is-your-worst-failure-so-far" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 12. What is your worst failure so far? </h3> <p>Nothing stays up forever. You’ve failed before, and you’ve failed hard. Tell us about it!</p> <p><strong>Consider</strong> what your biggest failure was, and write it on your character sheet. Did you develop an Intimacy because of it? Does it tie in to your Merits?</p> <h2 id="section-v-personality-and-behavior"> <a href="#section-v-personality-and-behavior" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section V: Personality and Behavior </h2> <p>We’re almost there. We’ve finished with the numbers so far, and now we’re on to the broad strokes of your personality – who you are as a person.</p> <h3 id="13-what-is-your-characters-greatest-virtue"> <a href="#13-what-is-your-characters-greatest-virtue" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 13. What is your character’s greatest virtue? </h3> <p>What virtue does your character embody? Try to think of virtues in terms of the Realm, not in terms of American society. For example, individualism is a virtue for most Americans, but the Realm does not value it in the same way as, say, filial piety or obedient execution of duty.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that is related to your virtue. Or, <strong>consider</strong> how your character embodies this virtue and reflect on how it manifests in their behavior.</p> <h3 id="14-what-is-your-characters-heroic-flaw"> <a href="#14-what-is-your-characters-heroic-flaw" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 14. What is your character’s heroic flaw? </h3> <p>All good legends need a flaw. Greek heroes had their hubris, Sherlock his addiction, House his hatred of humans… Scooby and Shaggy their voracious hunger.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that is related to your vice. Or, you may take a <strong>flaw</strong> from the flaws to model addiction, etc. Your flaw is ideally something as broad as “misanthropy” or “hubris,” so that it can be relevant in different ways at different times.</p> <h3 id="15-what-do-people-notice-first-when-they-meet-you"> <a href="#15-what-do-people-notice-first-when-they-meet-you" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 15. What do people notice first when they meet you? </h3> <p>What do people notice first when they meet you? This may be something like your piercing eyes or animal magnetism. You might also consider something like how you are underdressed for your station, or how you always wear armor even while you should be safe.</p> <p>What stands out about you may also be your <em>reputation</em>. If you defy the norm for your House, people may notice that about you, and your reputation will precede you when meeting new people.</p> <p><strong>Consider</strong> what it is that stands out about you, and note it on your character sheet in the Notes section.</p> <h3 id="16-how-do-you-react-to-stressful-situations"> <a href="#16-how-do-you-react-to-stressful-situations" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 16. How do you react to stressful situations? </h3> <p>The Realm expects its Dynasts to keep a firm handle on their emotions at all times. Displays of passion are few and far between, and reserved for the most sensitive or important of topics. Otherwise, you are expected to maintain a steely mask of indifference.</p> <p>Obviously, this expectation of “face” can vary. Few would fault a Cynis for being joyous, for example, or fault a man for snapping out in public; after all, everyone knows men can’t control their emotions. It is still frowned upon, but it is clearly more understandable in these cases.</p> <p>What is your character’s tick? No one maintains a perfect facade at all times. Even the most stoic Cathak or iron-faced Ledaal will occasionally have an outburst or show of her true feelings. Maybe when your character is stressed she starts to drum her fingers, or she hums to herself or chews her lip.</p> <p><strong>Consider</strong> what noteworthy physical or verbal tick your character has that hints that they are under stress. Consider how it relates to the flaws of your Aspect – for example, an Air Aspect under stress may loose their understanding of other peoples’ emotions or become consumed by the “big picture” as an escape mechanism.</p> <h3 id="17-what-biases-have-you-inherited-from-your-society"> <a href="#17-what-biases-have-you-inherited-from-your-society" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 17. What biases have you inherited from your society? </h3> <p>You are the privileged scion of a mighty empire, so you’ve got <em>some</em> kind of belief or bias that you have inherited from your society. There’s some aspect of your personality that you as a player may not agree with, but you as a character should consider as part of your actions.</p> <p>A bias doesn’t necessarily have to be <em>bad</em>. For example, a monk may have a bias against peasants taking control of their own lives because she genuinely believes in the divine right of rule of the Dragon-Blooded. However, it’s generally easier to come up with a negative bias.</p> <p>Some common biases from Realm society may be:</p> <ul> <li>Men are too emotional and volatile to be trusted with responsibility;</li> <li>Men are better artists than women;</li> <li>Women are always scheming and backstabbing and plotting their next step up;</li> <li>Women naturally belong in control of house, society, and government;</li> <li>The divine right of rule is established in the holy texts;</li> <li>Cowards must be exiled from society if they abandon their post;</li> <li>Foreigners are exotic and interesting;</li> <li>Foreigners should accept the traits of the Realm when they become a satrapy;</li> </ul> <p>And so forth.</p> <p>Let me call out something very specifically here: You are not obligated to make yourself uncomfortable. You can absolutely skip choosing a bias – but I’d really encourage you to consider it. Your character is the product of an empire, and empires are not known for their wholesome nature. Not only can biases be an interesting trait to explore, they can also anchor your character to their society in surprising and theatrical ways.</p> <h2 id="section-vi-appearance-and-name"> <a href="#section-vi-appearance-and-name" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section VI: Appearance and Name </h2> <p>We are nearly finished now. What you look like and what you are called are important aspects of any character, and we will elaborate on them in this section.</p> <h3 id="18-what-do-you-look-like"> <a href="#18-what-do-you-look-like" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 18. What do you look like? </h3> <p>What do you look like? There are plenty of things to consider in answering this question. What color is your skin? Your hair? Your eyes? Do you have any scars or markings? Are you disabled in some visible way? How do you wear your hair?</p> <p>Most people on the Blessed Isle are Wàn, the ethnic group from the area around the Imperial City. The Empress herself is Wàn. The Wàn tend to be pale and slender, with large angular eyes and very prominent epicanthic folds; they look like East Asian people but with red or brown hair. Dozens of other ethnic groups native to the Isle have been absorbed by the Realm, and their traits still run strong outside the big cosmopolitan cities.</p> <p>Creation embraces an almost anime aesthetic when it comes to your hair and eyes; nearly every color is natural somewhere. Embrace your weird looks!</p> <p>In the section on <a href="/gear/clothing/">clothes</a>, you can read more about what fashions are prominent on the Isle.</p> <h3 id="19-what-is-your-characters-personal-name"> <a href="#19-what-is-your-characters-personal-name" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 19. What is your character’s personal name? </h3> <p>The dominant naming scheme is one or two-word names drawn from nature. Stuff like River, Menhir, Sunlight, Rain, Red Crane, or Shining Jade. If you want a word name but are having trouble, you can never go wrong with (Virtue) (Animal): Dutiful Sparrow, Swift Hound, Brave Ox, etc.</p> <p>The other name scheme is a phonetic name. These names rarely mean anything, and are mostly chosen because they sound nice. You should go for an aesthetic resembling Chinese, Japanese, or Indian names.</p> <p>Were you named in honor of a family member? If so, your name is probably based on theirs. Red Crane is named in honor of Silent Crane, or Banoba in honor of Bandasi.</p> <p>House names always come first, then the family name, then the given name. Most Dynasts drop their family name in casual use. Politeness dictates that you address a Dynast by their House name with an honorific; in our case, I’ll usually render that as “Master [House Name]” or “Esteemed [House Name]” or some such. Personal names are usually reserved for friends.</p> <h2 id="section-vii-the-end"> <a href="#section-vii-the-end" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Section VII: The End </h2> <p>Nothing lasts forever…</p> <h3 id="20-how-will-you-die"> <a href="#20-how-will-you-die" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> 20. How will you die? </h3> <p>Everyone dies eventually!</p> <p>Dragon-Blooded can live for centuries before they succumb to old age, but few manage that. Most Dynasts die gloriously before making it to a century. Life as a Prince of the Earth is always dangerous; the Realm says, “A Prince is always three feet from death,” referring to the normal length of a sword.</p> <p>How will you die? Will you go gloriously on a battlefield? Of old age surronded by wealth and family? Drowned at sea in a daring escapade?</p> <p>Most Dynasts are cremated in a public ceremony attended by friends, family, acquaintances, and complete strangers. Dynasts who are particularly devoted to one of the Immaculate Dragons may opt for a more exotic funeral.</p> <p>Pasiapites favor mummification and display in an elaborate mausoleum. Danaa’dists are often buried at sea, lowered into the ocean or a lake in a solemn ceremony. Devotees of Sextes Jylis are turned into mulch to cultivate sprawling guardians. And rarest of all, Melaists sometimes opt for a sky burial – to be flayed on an open plain and have their remains devoured by birds.</p> <h2 id="final-touches"> <a href="#final-touches" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Final Touches </h2> <p>You have now created your character, congratulations!
