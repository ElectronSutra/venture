<h1 id="20-questions">20 Questions</h1>

<p>What kind of character do you want to play? What is your history? What are your
beliefs and traditions?</p>

<p>The Realm is a society which is often dissimilar to our own. This process is
designed to guide you through a series of leading questions to help you build a
character that fits within the Realm. Your answers will guide you to create a
character that <em>belongs</em> in Creation.</p>

<h2 id="section-i-the-broad-strokes">Section I: The Broad Strokes</h2>

<p>These questions define your character in broad terms. These answers will inform,
but not restrict, your answers to later questions.</p>

<h3 id="1-what-great-house-raised-you">1. What Great House raised you?</h3>

<p>The dragons of the Realm mostly belong to the ten Great Houses. Each House is a
heroic lineage that stretches back to a legendary founder. Your House raised
you; your world is rooted in the world your House showed you.</p>

<p>When choosing your House, you should choose whichever House you find interesting
or whichever has a suite of themes you want to engage with. Each House will have
a different set of expectations and habits that it imposed on you as a child. It
is up to you whether you live up to them or rail against them.</p>

<p>Choose one of the following Great Houses which you were raised in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/cathak/"><strong>House Cathak</strong>.</a> A military house famed
for brilliant tacticians and powerful Legions.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/cynis/"><strong>House Cynis</strong>.</a> A luxurious and decadent
House with a reputation for debauchery and intrigue.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/ledaal/"><strong>House Ledaal</strong>.</a> A zealous and traditional
House devoted to upholding the social order.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/mnemon/"><strong>House Mnemon</strong>.</a> A proud, devout House
with a deeply-involved guiding hand.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/nelens/"><strong>House Nellens</strong>.</a> A scrappy House of
mongrels and thin-bloods.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/peleps/"><strong>House Peleps</strong>.</a> A beloved House of folk
heroes charged with maintaining the Imperial Navy.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/ragara/"><strong>House Ragara</strong>.</a> An obscenely wealthy
House of bankers and merchants with a finger in every pie.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/sesus/"><strong>House Sesus</strong>.</a> A secretive military House
with a reputation for spycraft and deviousness.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/tepet/"><strong>House Tepet</strong>.</a> An ancient military House
with a warrior tradition older than the Realm itself.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/great-houses/vneef/"><strong>House V’neef</strong>.</a> An upstart House, less
than 60 years old, trying to bust its way onto the stage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Define</strong> at least one Intimacy related to your House. How do you feel about
your House? About its reputation? Do you live up to your family’s expectations,
or do you defy their commands? Are you proud of your House? Embarassed? Does
your House embrace you as a success or alienate you as an embarassment?</p>

<h3 id="2-what-is-your-aspect">2. What is your Aspect?</h3>

<p>Every Dragon-Blood reflects all five elements in their soul. At the same time,
each Prince of the Earth feels a particular element more strongly than her
sisters. This element is your <em>Aspect</em>; it reflects your nature and informs your
legend.</p>

<p>Aside from House Nellens, each Great House has a dominant Aspect that manifests
more often than others. About half of all of a House’s scions will manifest the
dominant element; going against your House’s Aspect is not so rare as to be
noteworthy. You are free to pick whichever Aspect you like, regardless of your
House.</p>

<p>Choose which of the five elements you resonate with the most:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#air/"><strong>Air</strong>.</a> Air is subtle and clever,
but distant and cold.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#earth/"><strong>Earth</strong>.</a> Earth is enduring and
wise, but conservative and stubborn.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#fire/"><strong>Fire</strong>.</a> Fire is hot and
powerful, but impulsive and dangerous.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#water/"><strong>Water</strong>.</a> Water is flexible and
insightful, but duplicitous and malleable.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-realm/dragon-blooded/elements#wood/"><strong>Wood</strong>.</a> Wood is lively and
persistent, but hedonistic and venomous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having selected your Aspect, mark your five Aspect Abilities. In Lot Casting
Atemi, they will be automatically filled-in when you select your Aspect. You
get one free dot in each of these five Abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Consider</strong> how your Aspect influences your personality. All dragons reflect
their element in some way; or perhaps their element reflects them. In the notes
section of your character sheet, write down at least one personality trait and
one physical trait that reflect your Aspect.</p>

<h2 id="section-ii-skills-and-education">Section II: Skills and Education</h2>

<p>Your character has both natural aptitudes and learned skills. In this section,
we will walk through your innate talents, your education, and your professional
life.</p>

<h3 id="3-in-what-ways-did-you-stand-out-among-your-peers">3. In what ways did you stand out among your peers?</h3>

<p>Which of the following statements do you agree with the most? Which do you agree
with the least?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was physically superior; I was stronger, faster, or more durable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was socially superior; I was more charismatic, more wily, or more sensual.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was mentally superior; I was more perceptive, more intelligent, or wittier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement you agree with most defines your <em>primary</em> Attributes. The
statement you agree with second-most unsurprisingly defines your <em>secondary</em>
Attributes. The statement you agree with the least defins your <em>tertiary</em>
Attributes.</p>

<p>Every Attribute begins with 1 dot for free, congratulations. Now <strong>distribute</strong>
8 more dots among your primary Attributes, 6 more dots among your secondary
Attributes, and 4 more dots among your tertiary attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> at least one self-reflective Intimacy that relates to your
Attributes. If you have high Strength but low Intelligence, perhaps you consider
yourself a stupid brute; etc.</p>

<h3 id="4-what-secondary-school-did-you-attend-and-how-did-you-stand-out">4. What secondary school did you attend and how did you stand out?</h3>

<p>As an exceptional scion of one of the Great Houses, you were lucky enough to be
able to attend one of the Realm’s great secondary schools. You almost certainly
had very little say in <em>which one</em>; your family probably arranged it as soon as
you were born.</p>

<p>However you, as a player, get to <strong>choose</strong>. Congratulations! Pick one of the
following options for where you attended your secondary school:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Cloister of Wisdom</strong>. You were sent to the Cloister of Wisdom, a
monastery and school all at once. While there, you learned the virtues of
clarity, tranquility, and purpose. About half your classmates went on to
become monks.</li>
  <li><strong>The Heptagram</strong>. You were sent to the distant freezing Isle of Voices to
study at the Heptagram, <em>the</em> premier academy of sorcery and mysticism. You
were taught the values of wisdom, fortitude, and drive, as well as set down
the lonely path of the sorcerer.</li>
  <li><strong>The House of Bells</strong>. You were sent to the House of Bells; there is no
finer military academy anywhere in Creation! You were drilled in the virtues
of courage, strength, and discipline. You served for a time in the Legions or
Navy as a commissioned officer and probably have plenty of war stories.</li>
  <li><strong>The Spiral Academy</strong>. The Academy teaches one rule, and well: You cannot
rule without understanding what you rule. At the Academy, you were instructed
in the virtues of knowledge, subtlety, and precision. You probably entered the
bureaucracy,. and likely a handful of your schoolmates went on to be spies.</li>
  <li><strong>Pasiap’s Stair</strong>. Uh oh, you made a big fucky; or, you were really brave.
The Stair is a military academy, but it’s not like the comfortable life at
the House of Bells; no no, the Stair is an unforgiving march with no comfort
and no mercy, only glory. You are well-acquainted with your many foreign
schoolmates.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider</strong> how you stood out at school; were you especially studious, or
maybe unusually good at dueling? Pick 5 Abilities that you excel at; they
cannot be the same 5 as your Aspect. Mark them on your sheet as <em>favored</em>. You
get 1 free dot in each.</p>

<h3 id="5-what-skills-have-you-acquired-during-your-life">5. What skills have you acquired during your life?</h3>

<p>You have acquired skills from your time in primary school, your time in
secondary school, and your adult life. What are those skills?</p>

<p><strong>Distribute</strong> 20 additional dots, however you choose, among <em>all</em> the Abilities
on your character sheet. Think about your time as an adult and your prior
experiences to inform your skills. Perhaps you learned field medicine to justify
your points in Medicine, and so forth.</p>

<p>In answering this question, you cannot raise any Ability above 3 dots.</p>

<h3 id="6-what-areas-have-you-specialized-in">6. What areas have you specialized in?</h3>

<p>You have specialties in several skills; these are important because they
increase the power of some of your Charms.</p>

<p>Based on your secondary school, <strong>choose</strong> two of the three listed Abilities to
gain a Specialty. Remember, you must have at least 1 dot in an Ability to have
a specialty in it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you attended the <strong>Cloister of Wisdom</strong>, choose two specialties from among:
Integrity, Lore, Martial Arts.</li>
  <li>If you attended the <strong>Heptagram</strong>, choose two specialties from among:
Craft, Lore, Occult.</li>
  <li>If you attended the <strong>House of Bells</strong>, choose two specialties from among:
Archery, Melee, War.</li>
  <li>If you attended the <strong>Spiral Academy</strong>, choose two specialties from among:
Bureaucracy, Presence, Socialize.</li>
  <li>If you attended <strong>Pasiap’s Stair</strong>, choose two specialties from among:
Athletics, Resistance, War.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, <strong>choose</strong> three more skills to receive a Specialty.</p>

<h2 id="section-iii-duty-and-ambition">Section III: Duty and Ambition</h2>

<p>You are a scion of the mightiest empire in the world. You are neither idle nor
satisfied; you have duties, and you desire something more. This section will
help you determine them.</p>

<h3 id="7-who-do-you-owe-a-duty-to-and-what-is-your-duty">7. Who do you owe a duty to and what is your duty?</h3>

<p>You have not made it to adult life without acquiring attachments. You owe your
time and energy to someone or something – not just owe, but <em>want</em> to owe. This
is a burden you have <em>chosen</em> to take on – or you have chosen is your least bad
option.</p>

<p><strong>Choose</strong> who you owe a duty to. Are you employed, and owe your time to your
career? Are you a monk, and owe your duty to your faith and abbot? Have you
taken on a duty from your House, and owe it to your family?</p>

<p><strong>Choose</strong> your duty. Here are some examples of duties you might choose
to take on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are a minister. You have joined the bureaucracy and are part of the
execution of government. Maybe you work for the Treasury and travel the Isle
to collect delinquent taxes. Maybe you work for the Infallible Conveyors to
carry post to far-flung and distant villages. Etc. You owe a duty to “the
government.”</li>
  <li>You are a Legionnaire. You are a career soldier, and have served overseas in
enforcing the will of the Empress. You now take up arms on the Isle, hunting
down bandits and subduing rebellions. You owe a duty to “the Legions.”</li>
  <li>You are a merchant. You have become a respected trader, buying here and
selling there to accumulate jade for yourself and your House. You owe a duty
to “yourself.”</li>
  <li>You are a monk. You have eschewed personal wealth and even your own name, and
devoted yourself to the spiritual. You travel as a preacher and officiant, and
sometimes as a ringing strike to the ear to get the wicked back in line. You
owe a duty to “the Immaculate Order.”</li>
  <li>You are a senator. You have been nominated by your House to take up a position
in the Upper Chamber of the Deliberative, taking part in writing the laws of
the Realm. You owe a duty to “the Realm.”</li>
  <li>You are a spy. Your family has given you a cover – something harmless, but
that lets you get around. You gather up secrets and feed them back to your
House, or to the highest bidder. You owe a duty to “your House.”</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Your duty should be both active and flexible. “Active” means that it is
something that you <em>do</em>, and that you can pursue. “Flexible” means that it is
something you can pursue in various times and places – it is not confined to
something too specific to be relevant in various parts of our story.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> a Tie related to the person or organization that you owe your duty.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> a Principle that reflects your duty.</p>

<p>One of those two should be at least a Major Intimacy.</p>

<h3 id="8-what-do-you-deeply-desire-and-how-does-it-conflict-with-your-duty">8. What do you deeply desire, and how does it conflict with your duty?</h3>

<p>The Princes of the Earth are greedy and sneaky bastards, to a one. Oh sure, some
of them become monks, and some of them are good people, but all of them <em>want</em>
something. They all have a <em>goal</em>.</p>

<p>Your goal is something that you will fight for that is not your duty. In fact,
a good goal <em>conflicts</em> with your duty, at least occasionally. The simple fact
that you <em>want</em> A but <em>have to do</em> B can drive a pretty compelling story.</p>

<p>Your goal and your duty don’t have to always conflict, but they should at least
sometimes. To define your goal, ask yourself: what do I want so badly that I
will abandon my duty and possibly screw over my own people in order to get it?</p>

<p>As with your duty, a good goal is both active and flexible.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that expresses your goal. It should be at least Major.</p>

<h3 id="9-what-is-your-relationship-to-your-family">9. What is your relationship to your family?</h3>

<p>You already have an Intimacy related to your House. For this question, you
should think more specifically about your <em>family</em>.</p>

<p>There’s a saying in the Realm: “A good mother raises her child to be strong; a
weak mother raises her child to be happy.” That in itself about sums up how
parenting works in the Realm: affection from your parents is neither expected
nor derided, as long as you grow up to be a proper Prince of the Earth.</p>

<p>Were your parents close or distant? Did you have a favored sibling or nanny? Was
there a house slave that you were personally close to? Do you resent your
family, or do you love them?</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is <em>marriage</em>. It is absolutely expected in the Realm
that every Dragon-Blooded – monks excepted – will marry. Marriage is almost
always a primarily political affair, to consolidate the relationships between
two Houses or two families within the same House. Are you married? If you are,
what is your relationship to your spouse? If you are not, how have you managed
to evade your House’s matchmaking?</p>

<p>Have you managed to achieve a rare love marriage? Most Dragon-Blooded have
affairs outside of their marriage; this is accepted and even expected, as long
as they are discrete. Men face more stigma for affairs, since everyone knows
that men are irresponsible.</p>

<p>The other burden is <em>children</em>. Every Dragon-Blooded – monks excepted – is
expected to produce children about every twenty or thirty years, in order to
raise more scions for your House. Although the Realm is completely accepting
of homosexuality, sexual orientation is no excuse for failure to produce kids –
either you’ll grin and bear it and have a kid because love and attraction don’t
factor in to it, or you will be expected to seek sorcerous assistance to
conceive a child.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> at least one Intimacy related to a family member. Also <strong>consider</strong>
if you have a spouse and/or any children – make a note of them in the Notes
section of your character sheet. Perhaps they can be represented by a Merit
in the game – your spouse may be an ally, for example.</p>

<h2 id="section-iv-history">Section IV: History</h2>

<p>This section will guide you in defining your character’s history and legend
up to this point.</p>

<h3 id="10-what-advantages-have-you-accumulated-in-life">10. What advantages have you accumulated in life?</h3>

<p>Every character has a suite of <a href="/character-creation/merits"><em>Merits</em></a>, which
represent their advantages. Check out the Merits section for the complete list.</p>

<p><strong>Distribute</strong> 13 dots of merits however you like. Then, you get 5 more dots
to distribute among Backing, Command, Contacts, Followers, Influence, Language,
Resources and Retainers, to represent your privileged position in society. That
is a total of 18 points of Merits.</p>

<h3 id="11-what-is-your-greatest-accomplishment-so-far">11. What is your greatest accomplishment so far?</h3>

<p>What is the thing you have accomplished that you are most proud of? What is the
thing that others would consider your greatest accomplishment? <strong>Consider</strong> your
greatest achievement so far, and make a note of it on your character sheet.</p>

<p>This should probably tie in to your Merits – maybe it involves your Command, or
you were able to accomplish it because of your Backing.</p>

<h3 id="12-what-is-your-worst-failure-so-far">12. What is your worst failure so far?</h3>

<p>Nothing stays up forever. You’ve failed before, and you’ve failed hard. Tell
us about it!</p>

<p><strong>Consider</strong> what your biggest failure was, and write it on your character
sheet. Did you develop an Intimacy because of it? Does it tie in to your Merits?</p>

<h2 id="section-v-personality-and-behavior">Section V: Personality and Behavior</h2>

<p>We’re almost there. We’ve finished with the numbers so far, and now we’re on to
the broad strokes of your personality – who you are as a person.</p>

<h3 id="13-what-is-your-characters-greatest-virtue">13. What is your character’s greatest virtue?</h3>

<p>What virtue does your character embody? Try to think of virtues in terms of the
Realm, not in terms of American society. For example, individualism is a virtue
for most Americans, but the Realm does not value it in the same way as, say,
filial piety or obedient execution of duty.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that is related to your virtue. Or, <strong>consider</strong> how your
character embodies this virtue and reflect on how it manifests in their
behavior.</p>

<h3 id="14-what-is-your-characters-heroic-flaw">14. What is your character’s heroic flaw?</h3>

<p>All good legends need a flaw. Greek heroes had their hubris, Sherlock his
addiction, House his hatred of humans… Scooby and Shaggy their voracious
hunger.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> an Intimacy that is related to your vice. Or, you may take a <strong>flaw</strong>
from the flaws to model addiction, etc. Your flaw is ideally something as
broad as “misanthropy” or “hubris,” so that it can be relevant in different
ways at different times.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> some trinket or item you have that reflects your flaw – a gambler
may carry dice, hubris may be indicated by your collection of trophies, etc.</p>

<h3 id="15-what-do-people-notice-first-when-they-meet-you">15. What do people notice first when they meet you?</h3>

<p>What do people notice first when they meet you? This may be something like your
piercing eyes or animal magnetism. You might also consider something like how
you are underdressed for your station, or how you always wear armor even while
you should be safe.</p>

<p>What stands out about you may also be your <em>reputation</em>. If you defy the norm
for your House, people may notice that about you, and your reputation will
precede you when meeting new people.</p>

<p><strong>Consider</strong> what it is that stands out about you, and note it on your character
sheet in the Notes section. It’s a good detail to throw in if you are trying to
make a really impressive first impression.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> one distinctive aesthetic item that is associated with you – a
unique coat, a special necklace, a turquoise comb, etc.</p>

<h3 id="16-how-do-you-react-to-stressful-situations">16. How do you react to stressful situations?</h3>

<p>The Realm expects its Dynasts to keep a firm handle on their emotions at all
times. Displays of passion are few and far between, and reserved for the most
sensitive or important of topics. Otherwise, you are expected to maintain a
steely mask of indifference.</p>

<p>Obviously, this expectation of “face” can vary. Few would fault a Cynis for
being joyous, for example, or fault a man for snapping out in public; after all,
everyone knows men can’t control their emotions. It is still frowned upon, but
it is clearly more understandable in these cases.</p>

<p>What is your character’s tick? No one maintains a perfect facade at all times.
Even the most stoic Cathak or iron-faced Ledaal will occasionally have an
outburst or show of her true feelings. Maybe when your character is stressed she
starts to drum her fingers, or she hums to herself or chews her lip.</p>

<p><strong>Consider</strong> what noteworthy physical or verbal tick your character has that
hints that they are under stress. Consider how it relates to the flaws of your
Aspect – for example, an Air Aspect under stress may loose their understanding
of other peoples’ emotions or become consumed by the “big picture” as an escape
mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="17-what-biases-have-you-inherited-from-your-society">17. What biases have you inherited from your society?</h3>

<p>You are the privileged scion of a mighty empire, so you’ve got <em>some</em> kind of
belief or bias that you have inherited from your society. There’s some aspect
of your personality that you as a player may not agree with, but you as a
character should consider as part of your actions.</p>

<p>A bias doesn’t necessarily have to be <em>bad</em>. For example, a monk may have a bias
against peasants taking control of their own lives because she genuinely
believes in the divine right of rule of the Dragon-Blooded. However, it’s
generally easier to come up with a negative bias.</p>

<p>Some common biases from Realm society may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Men are too emotional and volatile to be trusted with responsibility;</li>
  <li>Men are better artists than women;</li>
  <li>Women are always scheming and backstabbing and plotting their next step up;</li>
  <li>Women naturally belong in control of house, society, and government;</li>
  <li>The divine right of rule is established in the holy texts;</li>
  <li>Cowards must be exiled from society if they abandon their post;</li>
  <li>Foreigners are exotic and interesting;</li>
  <li>Foreigners should accept the traits of the Realm when they become a satrapy;</li>
</ul>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>Let me call out something very specifically here: You are not obligated to make
yourself uncomfortable. You can absolutely skip choosing a bias – but I’d
really encourage you to consider it. Your character is the product of an empire,
and empires are not known for their wholesome nature. Not only can biases be an
interesting trait to explore, they can also anchor your character to their
society in surprising and theatrical ways.</p>

<h2 id="section-vi-appearance-and-name">Section VI: Appearance and Name</h2>

<p>We are nearly finished now. What you look like and what you are called are
important aspects of any character, and we will elaborate on them in this
section.</p>

<h3 id="18-what-do-you-look-like">18. What do you look like?</h3>

<p>What do you look like? There are plenty of things to consider in answering this
question. What color is your skin? Your hair? Your eyes? Do you have any scars
or markings? Are you disabled in some visible way? How do you wear your hair?</p>

<p>Most people on the Blessed Isle are Wàn, the ethnic group from the area around
the Imperial City. The Empress herself is Wàn. The Wàn tend to be pale and
slender, with large angular eyes and very prominent epicanthic folds; they look
like East Asian people but with red or brown hair. Dozens of other ethnic groups
native to the Isle have been absorbed by the Realm, and their traits still run
strong outside the big cosmopolitan cities.</p>

<p>Creation embraces an almost anime aesthetic when it comes to your hair and eyes;
nearly every color is natural somewhere. Embrace your weird looks!</p>

<p>In the section on <a href="/gear/clothing/">clothes</a>, you can read more about what
fashions are prominent on the Isle.</p>

<h3 id="19-what-is-your-characters-personal-name">19. What is your character’s personal name?</h3>

<p>The dominant naming scheme is one or two-word names drawn from nature. Stuff
like River, Menhir, Sunlight, Rain, Red Crane, or Shining Jade. If you want a
word name but are having trouble, you can never go wrong with (Virtue) (Animal):
Dutiful Sparrow, Swift Hound, Brave Ox, etc.</p>

<p>The other name scheme is a phonetic name. These names rarely mean anything, and
are mostly chosen because they sound nice. You should go for an aesthetic
resembling Chinese, Japanese, or Indian names.</p>

<p>Were you named in honor of a family member? If so, your name is probably based
on theirs. Red Crane is named in honor of Silent Crane, or Banoba in honor of
Bandasi.</p>

<p>House names always come first, then the family name, then the given name. Most
Dynasts drop their family name in casual use. Politeness dictates that you
address a Dynast by their House name with an honorific; in our case, I’ll
usually render that as “Master [House Name]” or “Esteemed [House Name]” or
some such. Personal names are usually reserved for friends.</p>

<h2 id="section-vii-the-end">Section VII: The End</h2>

<p>Nothing lasts forever…</p>

<h3 id="20-how-will-you-die">20. How will you die?</h3>

<p>Everyone dies eventually!</p>

<p>Dragon-Blooded can live for centuries before they succumb to old age, but few
manage that. Most Dynasts die gloriously before making it to a century. Life as
a Prince of the Earth is always dangerous; the Realm says, “A Prince is always
three feet from death,” referring to the normal length of a sword.</p>

<p>How will you die? Will you go gloriously on a battlefield? Of old age surronded
by wealth and family? Drowned at sea in a daring escapade?</p>

<p>Most Dynasts are cremated in a public ceremony attended by friends, family,
acquaintances, and complete strangers. Dynasts who are particularly devoted to
one of the Immaculate Dragons may opt for a more exotic funeral.</p>

<p>Pasiapites favor mummification and display in an elaborate mausoleum.
Danaa’dists are often buried at sea, lowered into the ocean or a lake in a
solemn ceremony. Devotees of Sextes Jylis are turned into mulch to cultivate
sprawling guardians. And rarest of all, Melaists sometimes opt for a sky
burial – to be flayed on an open plain and have their remains devoured by
birds.</p>

<h2 id="final-touches">Final Touches</h2>

<p>You have now created your character, congratulations! We have just a few last
finishing touches.</p>
