Most Merits don’t offer a distinct mechanical advantage, instead offering narrative potential. The benefit of a powerful ally is not that you can add dice, but rather that you can call in favors, etc.</p> <h2 id="social-merits"> <a href="#social-merits" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Social Merits </h2> <p>Social merits define your position in society or your relationships with other people.</p> <h3 id="allies--or-"> <a href="#allies--or-" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Allies [• or •••] </h3> <p>Each purchase of this Merit represents a powerful ally – a close friend or trusted companion with unique and useful capabilities.

They will not deliberately betray you, but they are <em>contacts</em>, not friends or allies; they may be wrong, or they may mislead your for their own ends.</p> <p><strong>Define</strong> your contacts by telling us their area of knowledge and where they operate.
