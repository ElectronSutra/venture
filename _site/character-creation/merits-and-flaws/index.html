<h1 id="merits-and-flaws">Merits and Flaws</h1>

<p>Merits are special advantages that your character possesses, such as allies,
relics, and soldiers. Most Merits don’t offer a distinct mechanical advantage,
instead offering narrative potential. The benefit of a powerful ally is not that
you can add dice, but rather that you can call in favors, etc.</p>

your ally. Give them two goals: one that aligns with yours, and one that might

Crownkiller Dragon, etc. How did it get that name? What does your unit’s

<h3 id="artifact--to-">Artifact [•• to •••••]</h3>

<p>An Artifact is a magical relic with its own legend. Every Artifact ••• or higher
can unlock <em>Evocations</em>, powerful magic tied to the Artifact’s history. The
ancestral staff of a famed Cynis politician spreads rumors and malice, or the
trident wielded by your once-Peleps father which he used to slay the behemoth
Dayôyu the All-Consuming.</p>

the wielder’s skill; a javelin that flies long distances and bursts into
flames.</p>

example, fans that cause stormclouds or armor that offers limited flight.</p>

<p>You own a <em>demesne</em>, a Place of Power. A demesne arises when the elemental and

god, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hearthstone-">Hearthstone [••]</h3>

<p>You own a <em>hearthstone</em>, a jewel of concentrated elemental power which bestows

<p><strong>Define</strong> your Hearthstone by telling us about the manse or demesne that
produced it, and give us an element. How did you come to possess it?</p>

<p>You own a <em>manse</em>, a magnificent magical fortress or palace built atop a Place
of Power to harness its energy.</p>

<p><strong>Define</strong> your Manse by giving it a name and an element. Tell us about the
history of this building – it is probably an inheritance from your family. What
purpose was it built for?</p>

<p>(This Merit grants you the benefit of both Demesne and Hearthstone for a slight
discount.)</p>
