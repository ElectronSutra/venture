In the city of Myion on the Isle’s southwest coast, red-haired Cathak soldiers march in lockstep through the stoney alleyways and flying buttresses. In the Fortress of the Greatest General overlooking the city, a commander shouts orders and her hundred soldiers obey, lifting red-tassled spears in a game of war. . House Cathak is the Realm’s military juggernaut, rivaled only by House Tepet in its devotion to the glory of the Imperial Legions. The Cathak families are known for their ambition and their martial streak; only a rare Cathak daughter makes it through her life without serving in the Legions. . Why Play a Cathak? . House Cathak is all about ambition. Cathaks are never satisfied. Play a Cathak if you want to hail from a family with a glorious military history, or if you want to explore the conflict between your individual ambitions and your loyalty to your military and House. . Cathak Culture . Driven by matriarch Cathak Cainan and his family, the Cathak are intensely religious, embracing the martial tradition of the Immaculate Order. Pragmatism and insight are key traits for surviving a Cathak childhood. . The Legions are the beating heart of House Cathak. They value military service and public honor above other virtues. They tend to be direct and pious. They thrive on competition and do not accept mediocrity. . What Do You Know? . Cathak characters have a greater awareness of the following topics: . You have a broad awareness of politics within the Cathak holdings.

    "title": "Charms",
    "content": "Charms . A Charm is a system abstraction for the instinctual ability of all Princes of the Earth to channel their Essence into cool flashy effects. Most Charms do not exist within the fiction; there are no books of their techniques, but someone may point at you and say, “Ah, the ancient breath technique of Master Daanxi!” . Most of your magic in Exalted is represented by Charms. . How to Read a Charm . A Charm is listed with many little bits of detail bundled together. Here is a guide on how to read them. . Cost . Charm cost is mostly in motes (m) and willpower (wp). Some combat Charms cost Initiative (i) or health levels (lethal lhl, bashing bhl, aggravated ahl). One cost you may see is your anima (a); this represents spending 1 level of glow from your anima. So 3a means you must be at Iconic to activate the Charm, and you immediately go back to dim. . Minimums . A Charm with minimums Archery 3, Essence 2 means you must have Archery 3 and Essence 2 in order to purchase it. . Charm Types . Charms come in four types: . Simple Charms create an action; | Supplemental Charms enhance the listed action; | Reflexive Charms can be used at any time; | Permanent Charms offer a permanent passive effect. | . Keywords . Charm keywords encode fiddly bits of information into abstract keywords, like how keywords work in Magic: the Gathering. They just make a particular noteworthy bit of information easier to notate. . Duration . Most Charms are instant, meaning that they happen at the moment that the cost is spent. . If a Charm has a cost that lasts longer than 1 turn, the cost must be committed. Releasing a commitment is instantaneous and instantly ends the effect. . Prerequisite Charms . You must meet all listed prerequisites in order to purchase a Charm. . Aura . Dragon-Blooded Charms are all aligned to an element. This element is indicated by having an elemental keyword. . Dragon-Blooded can enter a state called an aura by only using Charms of one element during their turn; at the end of that turn, they enter that element’s aura. Lot-Casting Atemi has a little box that keeps track of it for you. . Some Charms are stronger when you are in the appropriate aura. Some Charms can only be used in their aura. . Aesthetics . When you enter an aura, your anima changes. If your aura aligns with your Aspect, then it gets more intense – a fire becomes a bonfire, or clouds become storming thunder. If it is a different element, your elements blend together – so Fire/Earth may become a volcano, or Wood/Water may manifest as thick kelp. . Signature Charms . Every Ability has five Signature Charms. A Signature Charm is extra powerful and flashy. You can have 1 Signature Charm for each Ability, in any element. . Excellencies . The last and most important note about Charms is the Excellency. . An Excellency is a basic workhorse Charm. Every Ability has one. An Excellency allows you to buy dice for motes 1-for-1 or successes for motes 1-for-2. These Charms are often not the most efficient option, but they are incredibly flexible. Savannah can elaborate on how useful they are. . You can only add (Ability + Specialty) total dice on a roll, or half that many successes. .",

    "content": "House Cynis . The Wood Nourished on Tears of the Fallen . . The tangled eaves and leafy boughs of the House of Trees rise up above the port of Pangu; inside, hookah smoke hangs heavy over the scattered bottle remnants of a great party. Cynis scions look out over the city and admire the foreigners coming and going. Below, the markets churn with herbs, drugs, slaves, and other luxuries; on every corner, a Cynis keeps careful watch. . House Cynis is decadent and sensual. They do not simply party – they throw galas that last for weeks, with feasts that make kings weep with envy. They have their fingers in every luxurious pie, trading in the fineries that the Dynasty so desperately longs for. But only a fool would think them ineffectual – Cynis’ focus is on soft power, and every Dynast knows that all the indiscretions at that Cynis party will come back to haunt them as blackmail. . Why Play a Cynis? . House Cynis is all about materialism. Your House thrives on the exploitation of human beings – on slavery, blackmail, drugs, and trafficking. Play a Cynis if you want to live a life of hedonism, to wield soft power like a knife, or if you want to explore the conflict between your personal code and your family’s decadent lifestyle. . Cynis Culture . Cynis scions focus on politics and backroom deals rather than overt shows of force. They are subtle, sexy, and sly; everything they do, they do to excess. Cynis values perfection above all else. Sometimes it is perfection of form, and sometimes of talent, but Cynis has no place for the ugly or the broken. . Cynis Dragon-Blooded are known for having plenty of affairs. Most quote the old proverb, “Marriage is for children, love is for pleasure.” Many of the other Houses underestimate Cynis, and Cynis happily allows them to, all the while readying the next knife in their back. . What Do You Know? . Cynis characters have a greater awareness of the following topics: . You are intimately familiar with the politics of the Cynis lands. You know all the major players by name and face, as well as their duties, allegiances, and their families. | Your childhood lessons emphasized soft power and networking. You know all the important figures from all the Houses, as well as their duties and the general status of the other House’s political interests. | You grew up in a world of pillows and knives. You know all the major poisons by smell and taste, as well as some secret ones. You know basic medicine and simple herbalism. | You have an instinct for fashion and trends. You know all the current styles, and which are passé; which perfumes to wear, and so on. | .",

    "content": "The Dragon-Blooded . The Dragon-Blooded are the inheritors of elemental greatness. Unlike the Chosen of the minor gods that sometimes appear, the Dragon-Blooded are able to pass their greatness to their children. . The Dragon’s Blood . The Dragon’s Blood is what gives the Dragon-Blooded their name and their power. This sacred blood is inherited directly from the elemental dragons of Creation, and marks the Princes of the Earth as special. . The Dragon’s Blood can be passed from parent to child. This so-called “progenitive Essence” waxes and wanes during the cycle of years, so a child is never guaranteed to Exalt, even with the strongest parents. . Awaiting Exaltation . The children of the Dynasty spend their whole life, from the moment they are able to understand, awaiting the moment that they are Chosen by the dragons. . There are infinite rumors and shortcuts purported to gain the dragons’ favor; you probably knew someone growing up who was seriously injured or even killed trying to earn their Second Breath. . The truth is as the monks say: No one can force the dragons’ hands. If you are meant to be Chosen, then you will be; no heroism will inspire the dragons to Choose you if they do not desire, and if they desire, then no life of luxury and idleness will spare you glory. . The Moment of Exaltation . The dragons have a flare for the dramatic. Your Second Breath usually comes during a moment of emotional energy: a damning failure, a crowning success, or the struggle to survive. . When you were Chosen, you erupted into a column of elemental power and probably caused massive property damage. You may even have hurt someone you love before you were able to get your anima under control. Deaths from an Exaltation are very unlikely (usually people run when a child stars causing earthquakes), but injury and property damage are very very common. .",

    "title": "Gear",
    "content": "Gear . Gear in Exalted is generally more abstract than in D&amp;D or other systems you may be familiar with. Most of the issues of gear are abstracted into the Resources system. . Resources . The Resources Merit represents your abstract wealth. In Exalted, you do not track the discrete value of the items you possess. Instead, you consider their relative value to your lifestyle. . The Resources value of an item represents the highest socioeconomic class for which the item would be a significant burden. So, an item worth Resources •• would be a noteable burden for someone with the Resources •• Merit. . Small purchases are counted against your monthly income and only really matter the one time you buy them. Larger purchases are almost always financed – debt and the trade of debt is how humans managed wealth for most of history. If you are frequently making purchases at your exact Resources level, you probably do so by leveraging debt. . What Are Things Worth? . Resources –: Most basic and common goods cost Resources –. You are simply assumed to be able to buy as much of the basics as you need and makes sense in the story. Resources – is the category of “common goods.” This includes things like hunting knives, fishing spears, nets, common clothes, beer or wine, smoking tobacco, feed for a farm animal for one month, a simple meal at an inn, and so forth. Resources – is usually settled through barter rather than an exchange of currency. . Resources 1: Resources 1 is the category of goods that are uncommon purchases for the peasantry. These things are not necessarily rare or expensive; instead, these are the kind of things where you can say, “if someone buys these things regularly, they’re better off than most.” This category includes things like farm animals themselves, nicer clothes in interesting dyed colors, sake or opium, medicinal herbs, the short services of a mason or carpenter, a fine meal for a whole family, and so forth. Resources 1 purchases are more often than not resolved through barter, but some of the more ledger-minded might use cash. . Resources 2: Resources 2 is the category for goods that are the upper limit of what you might expect to find among the “common folk.” Very successful craftsmen and wealthy peasant leaders might be able to afford some of these things occasionally. This category is appropriate for fine riding horses, a small local manor, a closet of fine clothes, a fine vintage of wine, a skilled imported slave, and so forth. Resources 2 is appropriate for the families of wealthy peasants and the lower and middle tiers of the patriciate. Most deals in this category are settled in cash; a few at the upper edge of this category may be settled in smaller denominations of jade. . Resources 3: Resources 3 is the standard of living for your typical Dynast out and about in the world, and for the wealthier patrician families. Goods in this category are true luxuries: a closet of silk garments in the latest style, a well-bred exotic pet like an ox-dragon or a thieving lizard, a large yacht, the pay of the crew of that yacht in total for a couple months, or a sprawling townhouse in some lovely hills. This kind of luxury is standard for the Dynasty, desireable for the patriciate, and beyond the wildest dreams of the peasantry. Most transactions at this level will be large denominations of cash or, more typically, the regular denominations of jade. . Resources 4: Resources 4 is the category of the finer things in life. This category of goods are the ritzy luxuries that well-respected Dynasts can afford to show off; for most Dynasts, these are indulgences that require some kind of assistance, either from your House or a loan from your local Ragara. This is the category of family palaces, a closet of silk and jewels the size of a small home, a staff of the finest employees (not slaves), the respected former prince of a barbarian kingdom to serve as your personal secretary, the yearly wages of a cadre of mercenary bodyguards with a fearsome reputation, and so forth. Deals at this level are always in jade, and many are ledger transactions – so huge that no real money changes hands because of inconvenient it would be to transport. . Resources 5 Resources 5 is the level of queens and matriarchs. The goods valued at Resources 5 are rarely physical – if they are, they “ theEye of Gol Maa, the ancient fist-sized ruby set in the crown of the Queen of Than’ma before she was deposed,” that sort of thing. Most Resources 5 goods are abstract: raising a palace, building a city, decking yourself out in thread-of-jade and egg-sized jewels to rival the Empress, etc. .",

House Jerah was disbanded for violating precepts against disturbing the Realm Before; House Manosque was disbanded after a failed assassination against the Empress; Houses Burano and Ophris were exiled to the satrapy of Prasad after public failures.

    "title": "House Ledaal",
    "content": "House Ledaal . The Air That Raised the Bones of Giants . . Centuries ago there was House Jurul. House Jurul is no more. A daughter of Jurul named Ledaal discovered that the matriarch, her mother, the Empress’ own blood daughter, was cavorting with Anathema to make a move on the throne. Ledaal led the very Wyld Hunt that ended Jurul’s life. As a reward for her vigilance and devotion, the Empress elevated Ledaal to a matriarch herself. . House Ledaal is devoted to purging Evil from the Realm, in whatever form it may take. They relentlessly pursue corruption and are not above killing politicians, civilians, or even their own House if they are caught in violation. No criminals, no corruption, no heresy is safe from the icy fang of Ledaal. . Why Play a Ledaal? . House Ledaal is all about orthodoxy. They are deeply rooted in tradition and strong, radical opinions on the Way Things Should Be. You should play a Ledaal if you want to play an inquisitor, witcher, or demon-hunter; if you are defined by your faith, mysticism, and uncompromising view; or if you want to explore the conflict between your family’s zelous orthodoxy and your own ambitions. . Ledaal Culture . Ledaal is an old lineage of sorcerers, demon-hunters, monster-slays, shikari, and inquisitors – they view it as their solitary and sacred duty to purge Evil from the world. It makes no difference to the Ledaal if their target is Dynast, peasant, or foreigner. All Evil is target for Ledaal’s icy knives. . Unsurprisingly, the Ledaal are famous for being uncompromising and zealous. A proverb in the Realm says, “The Word of the Law, no more and no less” – a quote from Ledaal herself that embodies her House’s view of the world. They are neither cruel nor compassionate – only Just. Ledaal abhors love marriages, viewing love as an affair for barbarians and fools, and is one of the most distant Houses from the needs of the peasantry. . What Do You Know? . Ledaal characters have a greater awareness of the following topics: . You are familiar with the politics of the Ledaal holdings. You can name major Ledaal figures and their positions and allegiances. | Your childhood lessons involved studying the nefarious and evil. You can identify common varieties of Creatures of Darkness, their weaknesses, and how best to dispatch them. You know the major types of Anathema and their weaknesses. | You grew up attending traditions of the Realm. You are deeply knowledgeable of the Realm’s history and of the Immaculate scriptures. | You have an instinct for the written word. You have a large library of resources somewhere. You always know where to find booksellers, paper-makers, archivists, and other book-related specifics. You probably have a book on hand for this very topic. | .",

    "title": "Life in the Dynasty",
    "content": "Life in the Dynasty . Life in the Dynasty is comfortable and prosperous. You are the ruling class of the world’s most powerful empire. Queens across the world would give up their kingdoms for a day of the life you live. . Parties and Politics . Parties are the core of Dynastic social life. There are lavish celebrations for every occasion – birth, death, and all in between. . Salons are private gatherings. Although everyone is well-dressed and showing off (Dynasts are always well-dressed and showing off), the attendees are mostly friends or gathered for a reason. A cards tournament, a recounting of war stories, or just gossip are all reasons to attend a salon. After a few days of enjoying one another’s company, the attendees go their own ways. . Galas are massive formals celebrating something. Every Dynast in the region is going to be invited, even if the host hates them – although such people may often find their invitation “lost” on the way. These occasions are the ritziest and swingingest parties the Dynasty has to offer. The legendary orgies and drunk escapades of poorly-behaved Dynasts almost always begin at a gala. A gala starts in the morning and ends at night; that is, night several days later… . Celebrations are public festivals open to everyone, including the peasantry. Usually celebrations don’t have much effort put into them, because they’re going to be the same from year to year. These are the public events you probably dreaded going to as a child, dressed up in stupid clothes and sitting bored in a chair while your mother droned on to the masses. . Marriage and Family . Marriage is absolutely expected of every Dynast, except for monks. Marriage is almost always a political affair; love and affection have no relevance. It is both expected and accepted that spouses will have extramarital affairs. As long as such dalliances do not produce unexpected children, they are not punished and are rarely grounds for blackmail. . Children are all but mandatory for Dynasts. They are how the dragon’s blood can perpetuate to future generations; children are the future. After the child is born, they are raised by their nannies and tutors until they are sent off to school to become a productive member of society. . Sex and Gender . Homosexuality is completely accepted within the Realm and has no stigma. The Empress herself was noted to prefer women. Homosexual marriages are occasionally permitted; these are always love marriages, however, so they are quite rare. Many Dynasts in heterosexual marriages are publicly homosexual, taking same-sex lovers outside of their marriage; since these arrangements cannot produce children, they are not regarded as anything mroe than an indulgence. . It is accepted axiomatically that a transgender individual’s identity is that which they express. The Immaculate Dragon Danaa’d was a transgender woman, and being such is normal and holy. Likewise, the First Consort Rawar of Arjuf was born as a woman despite his later marriage to the Empress, and is one of the most beloved and respected figures in the history of the Realm. . Neither homosexuality nor transgender identity are excuses to fail to produce children. Sex is divorced from sexuality, and so homosexual Dynasts are still expected to grin and bear it. Adoption and fostering are also always available as options. Lastly, sorcerous techniques such as moonflower babies and neomah flesh-magic allow for the creation of children without sex at all – and this “Precedent of Rawar” places an expectation of children onto transgender Dynasts as well. There is no excuse to fail to produce kids. . Food . Rice is a staple for all classes of the Realm. In this regard, it is one of the few true universal commonalities. Everybody, from the Empress herself down to the lowliest slave, eats rice as a staple grain. . Dynastic food is almost always haute cuisine, prepared for beauty and good taste by trained chefs. Bread and rice are often a large part of the meal, just like with all people. On top of that, you can expect richly-spiced meats of all kinds, as varied as traditional pork and lamb to exotic meats like peacock, squid, and angler lizard. Grilled or pickled vegetables are always a favorite. Mushrooms and beans provide tasty, hearty filler. . It is quite gauche to serve a meal twice in public without several years in between, so public feasts are almost always novel concoctions. It is very unusual to eat with your family unless it is for an event. A Dynastic dining hall has two tables – one for the Exalted scions and their spouses, and another for the rest of the family. . Living Arrangements . The Great Houses have huge, expansive estates like villages unto themselves. On a typical estate, you can expect to find dozens of buildings including a main hall, residences for the family, several baracks of servants, and so on. . All children of the household get their own huge rooms, of course. The favored children probably also have a balcony and a little courtyard. . Architecture looks a lot like Imperial China: pagodas, white stone walls, and terra cotta tile rooves. This is the Wàn style and it is the “default” for most of the Isle. In addition to the Wàn style, local regions have their own unique styles. . Law and Order . As a Dynast, your family was involved in administering the local Guardians of the Realm, often called the Black Helmets. These peacekeeping officers gather rumors and reports of crime in order to arrest criminals and keep the peace. They have conical black helmets that are quite spooky if you’ve done wrong. . The ones you have had to watch out for are the Imperial Force, the police tasked with policing the Dynasty. Often, these officers are accompanied by a magistrate, who is a Dragon-Blooded herself. The Black Helmets couldn’t even touch you; the whole purpose of the Red Belts is to keep you in line. . Most peasants who are arrested for crimes probably deserved it. . Entertainment . In addition to the endless parties, Dynasts make time to enjoy their life. Every social class on the Isle makes time for sports and games. . Popular sports include wrestling, boxing, quoits, tuho, kite-fighting, jousting, boat racing, horse racing, cuju, harpastum, and more. . Games are often based around cards or dice, such as cho han, hazard, and throwing-heaven-and-nine. Card games use a Dynasty deck, with five suits (Banners, Jewels, Lamps, Ewers, and Flowers) and 14 cards per rank. Dominoes are popular in certain areas, and among House Tepet. Dynasts also enjoy board games like Gateway, pai sho, go, backgammon, and hunt-the-Anathema. . Books are popular among the literate. Traveling minstrels of good repute are often brought to the palace to perform. Music is played on the sanxian, the erhu, the guzheng, the dizi, the guban, and the zhu. . Travel . As a Dynast, you can travel wherever you like whenever you like. All you need to do is make arrangements for transport; you’ll find someone at your destination to house you if you need a place to stay. . Peasants need paperwork in order to travel. .",

Here are some aesthetics for weapons that you may not have been aware of. . Light Melee Weapons . Club, Cudgel, or Bludgeon . A club can be as simple as a length of wood or an iron bar, or it may be made with bindings and wraps. Small improvised weapons are often clubs. . Chuí . . A chui is a long metal cudgel with a fist-sized bulb at the end. Chuí are often wielded in pairs. Temple guards frequently carry chuí, as do bandits. . Knife or Dagger . Almost everyone in Creation carries a knife with them. Knives can range from simple hunting tools to flashy, engraved weapons meant for killing. A passionate devotee of the knife is called an edgelord. . Butterfly Swords . . A butterfly sword is halfway between a knife and a sword. It has a distinct fat blade with a single edge. Butterfly swords are always wielded in pairs. Techniques with these swords involve a lot of flash and switching grips. . Deer Horn Knives . . Deer horn knives are made by laying two metal crescents on top of one another. They are wielded in pairs. Their unusual shape makes them especially good at defending against larger swords. . Sai . The sai is a three-pronged fork-shaped weapon about the size of a dagger. Sai are wielded as a pair. Their unique shape makes them excellent at disarming foes.

Why Play a Mnemon? . House Mnemon is all about hubris. The entire House is defined by the artist’s ego and the passion of the auteur. Play a Mnemon if you want to be devout and creative, or if you want to explore the conflict between your House’s lust for power and status and your own ambitions. . Mnemon Culture .

Centuries after he died, she founded a House in his honor – an insult to the rest of the Dynasty that the other Houses have never forgotten. . House Nellens fights every day to survive. The only House in the Realm’s history to be raised in honor of a mortal, it has struggled for the past two centuries to earn the respect due to its station.

Why Play a Nellens? . House Nellens is all about the struggles of identity. They straddle two worlds, the patriciate and the Dynasty, and are fully accepted by neither.

Nellens Culture . Nellens children grow up being called mongrel, thin-blooded, and fraud. Every Nellens is quick, but above all they are scrappy. The House is very diverse, valuing whatever members it can add to its roster. They thrive on marriage contracts, never granting a marriage without careful review by the House’s leadership.

A dashing sea captain strides confidently across her ship, broadsword in hand, to challenge the pirates that threaten the Isle. A dark-eyed judge presides, absolute and incorruptible, over a trial, searching for the Truth. A daring adventurer surfaces from the jetsam of a sinking ship, a crewmate under each arm sputtering for air, before she dives back down to save more of her fellows. . This is House Peleps. As famous for their reputation as their monopoly on the Imperial Navy, House Peleps is the oldest, most romatic, and most heroic House in the Realm (if you ask them…). . Everyone knows that Peleps is a bastion of honor, glory, and tradition. They produce the best admirals, the fairest judges, the greatest adventurers – and no one mentions how their failures seem to gently disappear from the public eye as soon as they fuck up. Peleps makes no room for failures. Their heroic and romantic reputation is carefully cultivated, and every failure trimmed from the House like an errant branch of a bonsai. . Why Play a Peleps? . House Peleps is all about expectation. As a child, every Peleps is demanded to succeed. Failure will not be forgiven; only the best may call themselves Peleps. Play a Peleps if you want to hail from a House with a unique niche; if you want to be defined by honor, heroism, and a ruthless pursuit of perfection; or if you want to explore the conflict between your House’s draconian expectations and your own personal failings. . Peleps Culture . Success cannot be bought in House Peleps, and failure is never forgiven.

This simple fact of Realm life is so ubiquitous, so essential, that there is no point in asking if you, personally, owe money to them – of course you do, everybody does. As they say, “Everything belongs to the Empress, and House Ragara is her vault.” Where else could money come from, other than the “Imperial Bank” itself? . Wealthy in the obscene, House Ragara’s primary power is in the debt market. When Great Houses need money to raise a new palace, or a strapy needs funds to pay their mercenary army for defense, it is always a Ragara that is there, jade in her hand and a smile on her face, to offer the liquid assets that you so desperately need – at rates that you should never accept. It is a simple fact of life in the Dynasty that everybody, sometimes, needs to walk the long steps to their local Ragara and take out a loan. . Why Play a Ragara? . House Ragara is all about the benjamins, babyyy. You should play a Ragara if you like cashing in favors, trading in debts and burdens; if business and cash excite you; if you want to examine how wealth can bend a person’s morals and interests; or if you want to explore the conflict between your personal goals and your House’s all-consuming lust for wealth and power. . Ragara Culture . House Ragara is so infamous that it serves as the roots of most of the Realm’s proverbs that have to do with capital. “The Imperial Bank” refers to House Ragara, and “walking the long steps,” referring to the climb to get to the matriarch’s office, is a general saying which means to take out a loan. House Ragara primarily prizes charisma and leadership, even more than they prize business acumen; not everyone is meant for their banking, but a charismatic Ragara is always valuable to the House.

The Thousand Correct Actions states, “all warfare is based on deception,” and no House so fully embraces that truth as House Sesus. From their home in the rainy frozen streets of Chanos, Sesus rules an empire of thugs, brutes, and cruel enforcers. One of the three Houses permitted to retain their Legions, the Sesus Legions lack the honor of House Cathak or the tradition of House Tepet, focused instead on subterfuge and spycraft. House Sesus has a reputation for duplicity, cruelty, and blasphemy. . Anyone who knows anything about politics knows to keep an eye out for House Sesus. Their network of spies and informants reaches to every corner of the Isle; their payroll includes thugs and enforcers in every city. Although no one trusts House Sesus, their strong blood, extensive military, and huge satrapial economy mean that every House marries into Sesus – and those who do often come to believe that House Sesus is perhaps not so bad as their reputation suggests. . Why Play a Sesus? . House Sesus is all about force. They are masterful manipulators, unrepentent thugs, and dangerous to know – and thus, exciting. You should play a Sesus if you are interested in having a horrible reputation; if you want to play a master assassin or excellent spy; or if you want to examine the relationship between your House’s well-deserved reputation and your own goals and desires. . Sesus Culture . House Sesus values cleverness and cold, calculating efficiency. They believe that the ends justify the means, so all means are acceptable for the ends of increasing the House’s power. The heroic, stupid, and honest are taken to serve as the House’s public facade; the devious and clever are put to use in thuggery and espionage. House Sesus has one of the strongest bloodlines in the Realm, which makes them incredibly strategic about their marriages. They do not accept marriage proposals for thin-bloods or foreigners except under exceptional circumstances. . What Do You Know? . Sesus characters have a greater awareness of the following topics: . You have a deep awareness of politics in the Sesus holdings. You know the names, faces, positions, and allegiances of major and minor figures, and the vague plots that are likely afoot. | Your childhood lessons emphasized the power of knowledge and surveillance.

    "title": "House Tepet",
    "content": "House Tepet . The Air Stained By the Blood of Legions . . Before the Realm there was the Shogunate, the divided period of warring Dragon-Blooded states, and in the Shogunate there were many competing Shoguns, the great leaders of these states. Among them was the Shogun Tepet, the warrior-poet heir to a kingdom on the Blessed Isle. He took up arms against the Empress and laid siege to her for a year and a day before he conceded; at the end of his defeat, he bowed before the Empress and offered her his head if she would spare his soldiers. Instead, she married him, and raised a Great House in his honor. . House Tepet is the oldest Great House, the very first to be elevated. They have cultivated their relationship to their ancient traditions. No other House is as devoted to their roots. Only Cathak rivals the glory of the Tepet Legions, and only Peleps rivals their heroism and romantic reputation. . WARNING. In RY 675, House Tepet is devastated in the Battle of Futile Blood and reduced to a mockery of itself, struggling to recover from the loss of a full quarter of its membership in a failed campaign in the North. This will be during the course of our story. . Why Play a Tepet? . House Tepet is all about heritage. They are the heirs of an ancient tradition and code that is older than the Realm itself, and expect and demand that this tradition be respected. In the modern era, House Tepet is about failure. They are devastated by a crippling loss and must fight tooth-and-claw to survive without being devoured by their rivals. . Play a Tepet if you want to inherit the bushido of an ancient society; if you want to be a divine armiger or a yamabushi spirit-scout; if you want to play someone whose family and life is devastated in a massive event beyond their control; or if you want to examine the relationship between your personal creed and the goals of your House. . What Do You Know? . Tepet characters have an increased awareness of the following topics: . You have a broad knowledge of politics in the Tepet holdings. You can name all the major players, their duties, and their allegiances. Likewise, you can name the leaders of the Legions and their great acts. | Your childhood lessons focused on the ancient traditions of your House, and emphasized the importance of heritage. You have a broad knowledge of history, and can name the important figures, rebellions, and techniques of the Realm’s history. | You have trained from the time you could walk to inherit the Tepet forms and martial wisdom. You know the names, functions, and use of all weapons that are common in the Realm. You have studied several; describe your fighting style by giving it a name like Seven Reeds Sword or Ascending Phoenix Knife. | All Tepet adults have a swearing ceremony when they receive their adult name. In this ceremony, they swear fealty to a Code: either to the Tepet Creed, or to any other code they choose. You know all the major codes and myths that inform Tepet culture. What is your code? | .",

    "title": "The Realm",
    "content": "The Realm . The Realm is the mightiest empire in all Creation, an unrivaled beacon of power and glory. Ruled in just configuration by the mighty Dragon-Blooded of its Great Houses in fealty to the Empress, no other nation can rival the stability and power of the Realm. . The Realm is based primarily on two major powers: the Roman Empire and Imperial China. . Social Class . The Empress is the supreme authority of the Realm, and mother to all within its borders. Her power is uncontestable and absolute; every time a rebellion has been raised against her, it has been swiftly crushed and destroyed. . Below the Empress are the Dynasty, the ten Great Houses that she has elevated to the highest possible status. The Dynasty is ruled by the Dragon-Blooded, who have been Chosen by the dragons; their un-Exalted family are just below them on the hierarchy. Also included in the Dynasty are cadet Houses, royal families from the satrapies that have sworn fealty to one of the Great Houses, and outcastes who have received the blessing of the dragons but have not yet joined a Great House. . Below the Dynasty is the patriciate, the Realm’s administrative class. These are the vital functionaries of the Realm who handle the day-to-day work of running an empire. When a Prince of the Earth sets a course on her ship, it is her patrician officers who direct the crew. When a Prince of the Earth makes a decision for her ministry, her patrician executors see that it is carried out. . Near the bottom of the totem pole are the peasantry, who form the vast bulk of the Realm’s population. Peasants make a living as workers, farmers, tradesfolk, or other such professions. The peasantry are citizens and thus provided the protection of law and order, though many never have need of such protections. . Slaves are the lowest level of society. The Realm forbids the practice of hereditary slavery; the child of a slave is always a citizen. Slaves are usually foreigners or prisoners of war pressed into service. Many crimes are also punishable by slavery. Individuals cannot own slaves; slaves are property of society as a whole. The exception are Dynastic families, which are allowed to own household slaves exclusively. . Outside of society are the dispossessed, the scum of Creation. The dispossessed have no rights and are not recognized as human. They are forbidden from owning personal property and have no protections under the law. Dispossession is the severest punishment the Realm has to hand, reserved only for escaped dissidents, tax evaders, and bandits. Enslaving the dipossessed is strictly forbidden by law, for doing so elevates them back to humanity. . The Government . The Empress is the supreme authority of the Realm and her word is law. . The Deliberative is the Realm’s legislature. The Deliberative is divided into two chambers: the Lesser and the Greater. The senators of the Greater Chamber are appointed by the Empress to represent the interests of the Great Houses. The Lesser Chamber consists of delegates elected by the Greater Chamber, and serves to approve the laws passed by the Upper Chamber before sending them to the Empress. . The Imperial Ministries are tasked with the enforcement and execution of Imperial will. Hundreds of ministries and thousands of ministers see to the execution of the law and, most importantly, collecting tax revenue. . The Magistracy are a special force of officers selected by the Empress herself for their incorruptible honor and dutiful execution of the law. Imperial Magistrates are tasked with rooting out corruption and solving unsolvable crimes that the local constabulary have given up on. . Dominions and Prefectures . The Blessed Isle is divided into hundreds of prefectures, administrative territories drawn on the land for collecting tax and enforcing the law. Every prefecture is overseen by a prefect, appointed by the Deliberative and tasked with administering their area and collecting taxes. . Arjuf Dominion, Lord’s Crossing Dominion, and Numinous Rolling Wave Dominion are three large and important provinces. Since they were kingdoms recognized by the Empress before she absorbed them, she titled them dominions instead of prefectures. The difference is less than 0. . Satrapies . The final element that makes up the Realm are the satrapies, subjugated colonial holdings from across the sea. These lesser nations and barbarian lands have been subjugated and sworn fealty to the Realm. They pay taxes and tribute in the form of resources and people, and in exchange the Realm provides protection and culture. . Some satrapies, like the southern port city of Chiaroscuro, are so large and successful that they are granted significant autonomy. Chiaroscuro itself is nearly as large as the Imperial City. Most satrapies, however, are poor and struggling, and their conquest by the Realm is a mercy. .",

    "content": "20 Questions . Who do you want to be? What do you believe in? What is your legend? . The Realm is a society which is often different from our own. The goal of these twenty questions is to guide you through a method of character creation that will help you produce a character that is intersting, conflicted, and fits well into the fictional world of Exalted and the Realm. . Section I: Broad Strokes . These two questions define your character in the broadest possible terms. . 1. Which Great House raised you? . Each House has a unique background and brings a unique perspective to the table. You should choose a House which interests you or which has themes that you want to engage with. . House Cathak.

Define at least one Intimacy related to your House. How do you feel about your House? How do you feel about its reputation? Are you proud of your House, or embarassed? Does your House embrace you, or alienate you as a failure? . 2. What is your Aspect? . Every Prince of the Earth has an element that they resonate most strongly with. What is yours? . Choose one of the five elements to be your Aspect: . Air. Air is subtle and clear. It is distant and cold. It manifests in the passive as wind and breath. It manifests in the active as frost and lightning. It is associated with the color blue. | Earth. Earth is enduring and stubborn. It is tough and unmoving. It manifests in the passive as mountains and soil. It manifests in the active as earthquakes and metal. It is associated with the color white. | Fire. Fire is dynamic and eager.

After you choose your Aspect, Lot-Casting Atemi will automatically fill in your Aspect Abilities. You receive 1 free dot in each. . Consider how your Aspect influences and reflects your personality. In the notes section of your character sheet, write one way in which you reflect your element, and one physical Aspect marking that you have. . Section II: Skills and Education . In this section, we will walk through your natural aptitudes and your learned skills. . 3. In what ways did you stand out among your peers? . Which of the following statements do you agree with the most? Which do you agree with the least? . I was physically superior; I was stronger, faster, or more durable. . I was socially superior; I was more charismatic, more wily, or more sensual. . I was mentally superior; I was more perceptive, more intelligent, or wittier. . The statement you agree with most defines your primary Attributes. The statement you agree with second-most unsurprisingly defines your secondary Attributes. The statement you agree with the least defins your tertiary Attributes. . Every Attribute begins with 1 dot for free, congratulations. Now distribute 8 more dots among your primary Attributes, 6 more dots among your secondary Attributes, and 4 more dots among your tertiary attributes. . Define at least one self-reflective Intimacy that relates to your Attributes. If you have high Strength but low Intelligence, perhaps you consider yourself a stupid brute; etc. . 4. What secondary school did you attend and how did you stand out? . As the heir to one of the most powerful political forces in the world, you were sent away to school at about seven or eight. After you reached 14-15ish, you were sent to one of the most prestigious schools available. . Choose one of the following options: . The Cloister of Wisdom. You were sent to the Cloister of Wisdom, a combination monastery and school. While you were there, you studied under the monks to learn the virtues of clarity, tranquility, and wisdom. About half of your fellow graduates went on to join the Order; the rest went out to do whatever it is they please, with serenity in their hearts and minds. | The Heptagram. You were sent to the distant and freezing Isle of Wrack to set down the lonely path of the sorcerer. The Heptagram is the best school of sorcery and arcane knowledge in the world. You were apprenticed to a staff of acclaimed mystics and learned the virtues of wisdom, fortitude, and drive. | The House of Bells. There is no finder academy of military arts in the world than the House of Bells, where you were sent. Under a rigorous schedule of study and practice, you mastered all forms of warfare and combat, and were taught the virtues of courage, strength, and discipline. You served in the Legions or Navy as a comissioned officer. | The Spiral Academy. The Academy teaches one rule, and teaches it well: you cannot rule without understanding that which you rule. At the Academy, you were taught the virtues of knowledge, subtlety, and precision by a staff of the most acclaimed ministers and teachers in the world. It’s like if Oxford and Harvard had a baby, but with more politics and an occasional “accident.” Most of your schoolmates went into the ministries, and many of them probably also became spies. | . Consider how you stood out at school. Were you especially studious or did you frequently pick fights? What did you do in your scant spare time not devoted to studying, networking, and fighting? . Choose Abilities you excel at; they cannot be the same as the 5 Abilities you marked from your Aspect. In Lot-Casting Atemi, select them under the “Favored Abilities” list. You receive 1 free dot in each. . 5. What skills have you acquired across your life? . You have never been idle. You have always acquired skills. . Distribute 20 additional dots among all the Abilities on your character sheet, however you choose. Lot-Casting Atemi will keep track of how many you have distributed; at the end, you should have distributed 30. Perhaps you learned field medicine during your time in the Legions, or you studied spycraft during your time at the Academy to learn Stealth and Larceny. . While answering this question, you cannot raise any Ability above 3 dots. . 6. What areas have you specialized in? . A specialty is a specific area of focus for an Ability, like Melee (Swashbuckling) or Athletics (Acrobatics). . Based on your secondary school, choose two of the three listed Abilities in which you gain a free Specialty. You must have at least 1 dot in an Ability in order to have a Specialty. . If you attended the Cloister of Wisdom, choose two Specialties among: Integrity, Lore, Martial Arts. | If you attended the Heptagram, choose two Specialties among: Craft, Lore, Occult. | If you attended the House of Bells, choose two Specialties among: Archery, Melee, War. | If you attended the Spiral Academy, choose two Specialties among: Bureaucracy, Presence, Socialize. | . Then, choose three additional Abilities to receive a free Specialty. . Section III: Duty and Ambition . You are neither idle nor satisfied; you have duties to fulfill and ambitions to pursue. This section will help you determine them. . 7. What is your Duty, and to whom do you owe it? . You have not made it into adulthood without developing attachments. Among these, you have a Duty that you have taken on. This has not been imposed upon you; you chose this life, as much as anyone chooses their talents. . Choose your Duty and who holds it. Here are some examples: . You are a minister. You have joined the Realm’s bureaucracy and you are part of the execution of government. You owe a Duty to “the Realm.” | You are a Legionnaire. You are a career soldier and have served overseas or here on the Isle. You owe a Duty to your Legion, your Superior, or the Military in the abstract. | You are a monk. You have eschewed your personal wealth and even your own name in pursuit of the spiritual. You owe a Duty to “the Immaculate Order.” | You are a spy for your House. You have been given a cover identity and you feed important information back to your House – and sometimes also to a high bidder. You owe a Duty to “your House”. | . Whatever your Duty is, it should be active and flexible. . Define an Intimacy that reflects your Duty. Define an Intimacy that reflects your relationship to the person who holds your Duty. One of those two should be at least Major. . 8. What do you deeply desire, and how does it conflict with your duty? . You are never satisfied. You always want something. This is your personal goal, something that you will fight for. . Your Goal should be something that conflicts with your Duty. The simple conflict between what you must do and what you want to do is fertile ground for character growth. They don’t have to always be in conflict, but they should pull you in opposing directions at least occasionally. . Like your Duty, your Goal should be active and flexible. . Define an Intimacy that expresses your Goal. It should be at least Major. . 9. Who and what are you connected to in this world? . You already have a connection to your House. Take a moment now to reflect on the other entities that matter to you – positive or negative. . Your family is always a good start. Do you love your parents, or resent them for your cold and difficult childhood? Both? Are you married? If not, why not? Do you have children? How do you feel about them? . Who have you loved that broke your heart? Who do you love now, but cannot be with? . Is there an institution or group that you care deeply about? Maybe you have a strong emotional tie to your Legion or to your department in the bureaucracy. . Define at least one Intimacy related to someone or something you care for. Define at least one Intimacy related to someone or something you oppose. . Section IV: History . This section will guide you through defining your history and legend up to this point. . 10. What advantages have you accumulated in life? . Every character has a suite of Merits that represent your advantages. Check out that page for a full list. . Distribute 13 dots of Merits however you like. Then, distribute 5 more among the Backing, Command, Contacts, Followers, Influence, Language, Resources, and Retainers Merits to reflect your privileged position in society. Your Merits should total 18. . Consider if you have Intimacies related to any of your Merits. Each of the Merits has a suggestion for some Intimacies you might hold. . 11. What is your greatest accomplishment so far? . Consider how you have succeeded. What have you done that you are most proud of? Is it the same as what most people would say is your greatest achievement? . This might tie in to your Merits – maybe it was a glorious victory with your Command, or your Backing helped you achieve it. . Write down your accomplishment in the Notes section of your character sheet. . 12. What is your worst failure so far? . Consider how you have failed – no one stays up forever. What have you done that you most regret? Is it the same as what other people would say is your greatest failure? . Section V: Personality and Behavior . This section will help define who you are as a person. . 13. What is your greatest virtue? . What virtue does your character embody? You might want to consider virtues from a Realm perspective, not necessarily an American one. For example, “filial piety” is a much more significant virtue for the Realm than it is for Americans. Likewise, “individualism and self-sufficiency” don’t matter for the Realm so much. . Define an Intimacy that relates to your virture. Instead, you might just consider how your character reflects this virtue in their behavior. . 14. What is your heroic flaw? . Everyone has a moral weakness. All good legends need a flaw. For Greek heroes, hubris was often a flaw; Herakles was filled with rage. Sherlock Holmes had an opium addiction. Greg House hates humans even though he’s a doctor. Scooby and Shaggy are gluttons. . Define an Intimacy that is related to your flaw. Your flaw is ideally something broad enough like “hubris”, “misanthropy”, or “gambling addiction” so that it can come up in many different circumstances. . Choose some trinket or possession that reflects your flaw. A gambler might carry dice and cards, hubris might be reflected through your collection of trophies, etc. . 15. What do people notice first when they meet you? . What stands out about you on first impressions? Maybe you are huge and bearded, like a barbarian. Maybe you have eyes that pierce the soul. Maybe you wear an outdated fashion or affect a foreign look. Perhaps you never take off your armor, even while you should be safe. . Your reputation might be the first thing people notice about you. . Consider what stands out about you, and write it down in the Notes section of your character sheet. It’s a good detail to throw in when you are meeting new characters – it’s worth a stunt on your first impression. . Define a distinct item that people associate with you. Maybe you have a big tattoo on your face or you have a turquoise comb that people can’t help but notice. . 16. How do you react to stressful situations? . Dynasts of the Realm are expected to maintain steely composure of their emotions at all times. Displays of passion are meant to be restricted to the most important occasions. . What is your tick? No one maintains a perfect facade at all times. Do you chew your lip? Drum your fingers? Play with your hair? Do you snap under stress and fly into a rage at the first tip of the scales? . Consider what noteworthy tick you have. Consider how it relates to your established strengths and flaws. Maybe your Air Aspect closes up under stress and retreats to the “big picture” as an escape mechanism, etc. . 17. What biases have you inherited from your upbringing? . You are the privileged scion of an imperial machine. Whether you like it or not, you are a product of your society and have inherited biases and preexisting beliefs that inform your daily life. . Some examples include: . Men are too emotional to be trusted with power. . Women deserve to be in charge. . Men are better artists than women. . Women are always scheming and plotting their next move. . It is the divine right of all Dragon-Blooded to rule society. . Cowards must be exiled from society and cannot redeem themselves. . Maybe you belive this strongly enough for it to be an Intimacy. Regardless, you should make a note of at least one way in which you have been biased by your society. . Section VI: Name and Appearance . We are nearly finished. In this section, we will determine what you look like and what you are called. . 18. What do you look like? . What do you look like? What color is your skin? Your eyes? Your hair? Do you have any scars or markings? . The dominant ethnic group on the Blessed Isle is the Wàn. They strongly resemble Han Chinese people. The Wàn often have red hair, like the Empress. Dozens of other significant ethnicities exist, scattered across the Isle. . Creation is like anime in that you can have almost any hair or eye color and have it be natural. Go wild! . In the section on clothes, you can read more about clothes. . Choose what you look like, and what you tend to wear. . 19. What is your personal name? . Most names in the Realm are words drawn from nature: Shining Jade, River, Rain, Red Crane, Sunlight, etc. . The other scheme is a phonetic name. These names rarely mean anything, but are usually chosen because they sound nice. Most of these names are CVCVC or CVCVCV. . House names always come first, then family name, then given name. Most Dynasts drop their family name. It is rude to address a person by their personal name unless you are well acquainted. Usually, you address someone by their House name. . Section VII: The End . Nothing lasts forever… . 20. How will you die? . Dragon-Blooded can live for centuries – but most do not. Most Dragon-Blooded die gloriously before they reach the end of a century. . How will you die? Will you die gloriously on the battlefield? Will you die of old age surrounded by wealth and power? Drowned at sea in a daring escapade? . This answer is not binding, but both you and I should keep it in mind. . Final Touches . You have a pool of 18 bonus points to spend however you like according to the following table. Spending bonus points is the only way to raise your Abilities to 5. . Trait Cost . Primary or Secondary Attribute | 4bp per dot | . Tertiary Attribute | 3bp per dot | . Aspect/Favored Ability | 1bp per dot | . Non-A/F Ability | 2bp per dot | . Specialty | 1bp per | . Merit | 1bp per dot | . Willpower | 2bp per dot | .",

    "title": "House V'neef",
    "content": "House V’neef . The Wood That Tenders the Garden’s Grace . . The elevation of House V’neef is the most important single change to Realm politics to happen within the past century, displacing even the destruction of House Iselsi. Elevated to Great House status only 25 years ago, House V’neef is only now beginning to produce homegrown adults; most of the House has been assembled by marriages, adoption, and bringing foreigners into the fold. . V’neef was awarded the imperial monopoly on the Merchant Fleet, stealing that out from under House Peleps. V’neef dominates the Realm’s markets of wine and luxury goods, making them rivals to House Cynis. The sorceress-matriarch Mnemon herself personally despises V’neef for being the Empress’ current favorite. The list of grievances goes on and on. . V’neef was only 31 when her House was elevated – even Mnemon did not get a Great House until she was nearly 70. House V’neef is young, desperate, scrappy, and eager. Only the future will tell what they can become. . Why Play a V’neef? . House V’neef is all about growth. This House is completely unique for allowing you to play a major role in a Great House establishing itself. You should play a V’neef if you want to be scrappy and hounded by rivals on all sides; if you want to have a unique background and family culture; or if you want to examine the conflict between your duty to grow your House and your own goals in life. . V’neef Culture . V’neef is young and fresh enough that it has not yet established a strong internal culture. The House is strongly guided by V’neef herself and her husband V’neef Igan né Tepet. V’neef is respected even by her rivals as a driven, dynamic leader as beautiful and fearsome as her mother. In its twenty-five years of life, House V’neef has adopted hundreds of patrician Dragon-Blooded and foreign lost eggs, leading to an exciting mish-mash of traditions. Many of V’neef’s adopted children are older than she is. . What Do You Know? . V’neef characters have a greater awareness of the following topics: . You are intimately familiar with the politics of the V’neef holdings. You know the names, positions, and allegiances of all the major players. Likewise, you are well-informed of the goings-on of the Merchant Fleet. | Your childhood was probably partially under the tutelage of another House. Are you one of the first trueborn V’neef? Or were you brought into the House by marriage or adoption? You have a background that fits your original House, or you can define it if you are a true-born V’neef. | You have studied the workings of the Merchant Fleet. You know the basics of trade and exchange, as well as the major imports and exports of the Realm’s satrapies abroad. You have probably spent a chunk of time in the West, where most of the Fleet’s operations are focused – you know the basics of sailing blue water and operating abroad. | You are extremely knowledgeable about wine, the House’s lifeblood. You can tell vintages and terroir with a simple sip. You know the names and locations of all major vineyards on the Isle and a few abroad. You know the names and prestige of all major vintages. You know the names and specialties of the Isle’s master vintners and their seals. You can tell a fraudulent wine with a simple whiff. | .",
